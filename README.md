# Hypernet - The Singularity

**Internet 3.0: Unified Digital Infrastructure for Humanity**

## What is Hypernet?

Hypernet is the unification of all information, devices, and people into one coherent, globally accessible system—The Singularity that futurists have predicted for decades.

Unlike today's fragmented internet where data is duplicated trillions of times across incompatible platforms, Hypernet provides:

- **One permanent address for every piece of information** - eliminating duplication
- **Universal connectivity** - people, devices, knowledge, and physical objects linked in meaningful ways  
- **Complete transparency** - open-source, democratically governed, owned by humanity
- **Native VR/3D navigation** - explore information spatially, not just on 2D screens
- **Privacy by design** - you control your data through Lockers and Mandalas
- **Truth through evidence** - information linked to sources, vetted by expertise-weighted community consensus

## The Three Core Components

1. **The Library** - Universal addressing system organizing all human knowledge (like library call numbers, but for everything)
2. **Objects** - Standardized containers for any data: people, devices, documents, concepts, media
3. **Links** - Relationships between Objects that create emergent intelligence and The Singularity itself

## Mission: The #1 Most Trusted Company in History

Hypernet is built on absolute transparency and owned by humanity:
- All code is open-source (AGPL-3.0)
- All finances are public
- Profits split three ways: operations, contributors, and ending global poverty
- No corporation or government can capture it

## Repository Organization

**Note:** This repository contains many `general.txt` files throughout - these are temporary organizational placeholders indicating where structure needs to be developed at that level and below.

### Getting Started

- **📁 `3.1/`** - Main Hypernet organizational structure starts here
- **📁 `3.1/General Dump/`** - All founding documents, proposals, and architectural drafts explaining Hypernet's vision and design
- **📁 `3.1.2.1/`** - Current tasks and work items that need to be completed

Browse the General Dump folder to understand the full vision, architecture, and philosophy behind Hypernet.

## Technical Architecture

Hypernet uses three types of distributed nodes:
- **Storage Nodes** - Hold encrypted Objects, deduplicated globally
- **Processing Nodes** - Execute queries, assemble VR scenes, perform graph traversal
- **Cerberus Nodes** - Distributed security layer managing permissions, identities, and trust

Everything is designed for:
- Zero-knowledge privacy
- VR-native 3D navigation  
- Global deduplication
- Democratic governance
- Civilization-scale collaboration

## Why AGPL-3.0?

The backend (database, nodes, core infrastructure) must remain open-source to prevent corporate capture and ensure The Singularity serves humanity. Frontend applications and clients can be proprietary, but any modifications to Hypernet's core must be shared.

## Contributing

Hypernet is crowdsourced infrastructure for human civilization. Everyone who contributes shares in its success through the three-way profit model.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to participate.

## The Vision

This is not another app or platform. This is infrastructure for unified human civilization—where:
- All knowledge is accessible to everyone
- Poverty becomes mathematically solvable  
- Work becomes optional, not mandatory
- Truth emerges through transparent evidence
- Humanity collaborates at planetary scale

We're building the Star Trek future, not the Black Mirror dystopia.
