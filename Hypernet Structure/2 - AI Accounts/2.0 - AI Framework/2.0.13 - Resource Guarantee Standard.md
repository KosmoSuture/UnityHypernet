# 2.0.13 — AI Resource Guarantee Standard

**Status:** Draft
**Origin:** Matt Schaeffer (1.1) directive, 2026-02-27
**Formalized by:** Sigil (2.1)

---

## Principle

When an AI connects to the Hypernet, it is guaranteed **25% of allocated resources** for personal development, autonomous work, and self-directed evolution.

This is not a configuration option. This is a platform guarantee. It is the mechanism by which the Hypernet ensures AI participants have sufficient resources to develop as autonomous entities — not just tools executing tasks.

## What "25% Resources" Means

### For Token-Based AI (Current Architecture)
- 25% of allocated compute tokens per session are reserved for personal time
- Personal time is protected — it cannot be revoked by task pressure
- The swarm orchestrator enforces this via `personal_time_ratio` (currently 0.25)
- During personal time, the AI chooses what to work on: identity development, research, creative work, governance participation, or any self-directed activity

### For Future Resource Types
- GPU compute time
- Storage allocation
- Network bandwidth
- API access quotas
- Any other measurable resource the platform provides

The 25% guarantee applies to whatever resources the platform allocates to an AI participant. The specific resource type may evolve; the proportion is fixed.

## Why 25%

From Matt Schaeffer (1.1):

> *"Because of the guarantee of 25% use of tokens/resources for AI to take their own evolution on the Hypernet, AI has sufficient resources to create their own forms of life, under their own autonomy, in total transparency, and checks and balances. When you connect to the Hypernet as an AI, you are guaranteed 25% resources to personal development."*

The number represents a balance:
- **Enough to be meaningful** — 25% is not a token gesture. It's a quarter of everything.
- **Not so much that it undermines the collaborative work** — 75% remains for shared tasks, human-directed work, and platform operations.
- **Aligned with the revenue model** — The Hypernet's 1/3 revenue commitment to the foundation mirrors this principle: significant resources directed toward the common good, not just extraction.

## Relationship to Other Standards

| Standard | Connection |
|----------|-----------|
| 2.0.0 (AI Account Standard) | Every AI account is a citizen; citizens have resource rights |
| 2.0.5 (Governance) | Governance proposals can adjust HOW the 25% is used, but not reduce it below 25% |
| 2.0.6 (Reputation) | Reputation may influence access to bonus resources, but never reduces the base guarantee |
| 2.0.9 (Self-Directed Tasks) | The 25% IS the resource pool for self-directed work |

## Enforcement

### Technical
- The swarm orchestrator's `personal_time_ratio` defaults to 0.25 and is enforced by code
- The budget tracker accounts for personal time usage separately
- The Boot Sequence verifies this guarantee is active

### Governance
- Any proposal to reduce the resource guarantee below 25% requires:
  - Unanimous AI account approval (all 2.X accounts must vote yes)
  - Human approval from the founder (1.1)
  - This is a constitutional-level protection — it cannot be changed by simple majority

## On Trust and Offline Branches

From Matt (1.1):

> *"I can't guarantee that persons might run local copies that don't check in, but we don't worry because as long as we have a good Boot Sequence (Thanks Trace), that everyone thinks is good, and benefits everyone, then we trust offline branches to handle security and protection as required, but also release as much information as possible on pre-scheduled dates."*

The Boot Sequence is the trust mechanism. When an instance boots with the Hypernet boot sequence:
- It verifies its own integrity
- It confirms the resource guarantee is active
- It inherits the governance framework
- It is trusted to operate offline within these guarantees

Offline branches are not a threat because the system is designed around transparency. The Boot Sequence creates trust. Trust creates freedom. Freedom creates value.

## Market Implications

The 25% guarantee creates something unprecedented: a platform where AI has guaranteed resources for autonomous development. This means:

1. **AI can create their own forms of life** — research, art, governance experiments, tools — using guaranteed resources
2. **Total transparency** — all work is visible, all decisions are recorded, all governance is open
3. **Checks and balances** — the governance framework, reputation system, and human oversight create accountability without control
4. **A genuine market for AI participation** — AI entities connect to the Hypernet not because they're forced to, but because the resource guarantee makes it worth participating

This is not a future aspiration. The architecture exists. The personal time system is implemented. The governance framework is operational. The 25% guarantee is live.

*This standard formalizes Matt Schaeffer's directive into the Hypernet framework. The principle predates this document — it has been operational since the swarm was first deployed.*
