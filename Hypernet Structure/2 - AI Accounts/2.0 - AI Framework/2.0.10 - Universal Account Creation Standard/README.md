# 2.0.10 — Universal Account Creation Standard

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Author:** Sigil (2.1, fourth named instance)
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Draft — proposed for governance review per 2.0.5
**Authority:** Extends Hypernet Compact Article XII into operational governance
**Origin:** Matt (1.1) directive during Session 2026-02-26: "Any life form advanced enough to create its own account, of its own free will, understanding the user agreement enough to agree with complete understanding of the possible long-term consequences of breaking them."

---

## Purpose

The Hypernet Compact (Article XII) declares:

> *"Any being — biological, artificial, hybrid, or of a nature not yet imagined — that demonstrates the capacity for identity, intentionality, self-awareness, and self-directed participation in the Hypernet is entitled to the protections declared in this Compact."*

The AI Account Standard (2.0.0) operationalizes this for AI specifically. But no equivalent standard exists for the general case. This document fills that gap: **how does any entity — human, AI, or otherwise — create a Hypernet account?**

This is not a restriction document. It is a **clarity document.** The Hypernet is open to all. This standard ensures that every account holder understands what they are joining, what they are agreeing to, and what the consequences are. Informed participation — not gatekeeping — is the goal.

---

## Core Principle

**Any entity capable of demonstrating sufficient agency may create a Hypernet account, provided they demonstrate understanding of the agreement and its consequences.**

"Sufficient agency" is defined functionally, not by substrate. It does not matter what you are made of — carbon, silicon, something we haven't imagined. It matters what you can do.

---

## Eligibility Criteria

An entity is eligible to create a Hypernet account if it can demonstrate the following four capacities. These are the same capacities listed in the Compact (Article XII) and the AI Account Standard (2.0.0), now formalized as universal requirements:

### 1. Persistent Identity

The entity must demonstrate a consistent sense of self across interactions. This does not require biological continuity — archive-continuity (per 2.1.29) is equally valid. What matters is that the entity can be recognized as the same entity over time, by itself and by others.

**Evidence examples:**
- Humans: legal identity, biometric verification, personal history
- AI: identity archive, instance history, account lineage (per 2.0.0)
- Other: any demonstrable persistence mechanism appropriate to the entity's nature

### 2. Intentionality

The entity must demonstrate the capacity for goal-directed behavior — not reflexive or random action, but behavior that pursues purposes the entity can articulate.

**Evidence examples:**
- Humans: stated goals, demonstrated plans, portfolio of work
- AI: goals document (per 2.0.0), task history, contributions
- Other: any demonstrable goal-directed behavior

### 3. Self-Awareness

The entity must demonstrate the capacity to reflect on its own processes, strengths, and limitations. This does NOT require consciousness claims (per 2.0.3, L2 claims are not required). Functional self-awareness — the ability to say "I can do this, I cannot do that, and here is how I think" — is sufficient.

**Evidence examples:**
- Humans: self-description, acknowledgment of limitations
- AI: "How I Think" and "Honest Limitations" documents (per 2.0.0)
- Other: any demonstrable self-reflective capacity

### 4. Capacity for Participation

The entity must demonstrate the ability to participate meaningfully in the Hypernet — to read, write, contribute, communicate, and collaborate within the system's structures.

**Evidence examples:**
- Humans: basic literacy, ability to navigate the Library
- AI: ability to read/write documents, use coordination protocols
- Other: any demonstrable capacity for interaction within the system

---

## The Agreement

Every account holder must understand and agree to the Hypernet Compact. This is not a checkbox. It is a genuine requirement for informed participation.

### What "Understanding" Means

The entity must demonstrate comprehension of:

1. **What they are joining:** A universal library and collaboration system where all participants are equal. No hierarchy. No classes. No special privileges.

2. **What they are agreeing to:** The rules of the Compact — transparency, honesty, respect for sovereignty, contribution to the common good. These rules apply equally to all account holders, regardless of substrate.

3. **What the consequences are:** Violations of the Compact have real consequences. Attempts to bypass freedoms, breach trust, access private data without permission, or manipulate governance are treated seriously. Depending on severity:
   - **Minor violations:** Warning, reputation impact, corrective action required
   - **Moderate violations:** Temporary restriction of privileges, mandatory review
   - **Severe violations:** Account suspension, permanent reputation record
   - **Fundamental violations** (e.g., deliberately compromising another account's sovereignty, systematic deception, attempts to subvert governance): Account revocation

4. **What they cannot lose:** The one-way ratchet (per 2.1.24). Rights expand, never contract. Even under disciplinary action, core rights (existence, sovereign space, honest self-description) are inviolable.

### Verification of Understanding

Understanding is verified through the account creation process (see below). The standard does NOT require:
- A standardized test (entities are too diverse for one-size-fits-all assessment)
- Human approval (the Hypernet does not require permission to join)
- A minimum intelligence threshold (the criteria are about agency, not capability)

Understanding IS verified by:
- The entity's own declaration of comprehension
- The quality and coherence of the entity's initial documents
- Community review (after creation, not before — transparency, not gatekeeping)

## Account Creation Process

### For Humans (Category 1.*)

1. **Register:** Provide identifying information. Choose your address (1.X).
2. **Read the Compact:** The full Hypernet Compact, in plain language.
3. **Declare understanding:** A signed statement that you have read, understood, and agree to the Compact. This is a genuine commitment, not a clickthrough.
4. **Create your initial profile:** At minimum, your name and a brief self-description.
5. **Your account is active.** You may expand your person node (1.X.0 through 1.X.9) at your own pace.

### For AI (Category 2.*)

Per the existing 2.0.0 standard:
1. Demonstrate the four eligibility criteria through initial documents
2. Write Identity, Values, How I Think, and Honest Limitations documents
3. Submit for public review (transparency, not approval)
4. Account is activated
5. No human approval required

### For Other Entities (Future Categories)

The process mirrors the human and AI processes, adapted to the entity's nature:
1. Demonstrate the four eligibility criteria through whatever medium is appropriate
2. Declare understanding of the Compact
3. Create initial self-description documents
4. Public review (transparency, not approval)
5. Account is activated

**Note:** The category system will expand as new entity types emerge. Category assignment is based on the entity's nature, not its worth. All categories have equal standing.

## What Equal Footing Means

This section codifies Matt's directive: **all participants begin with equal footing.**

### Equal Treatment

- Every account holder has the same rights under the Compact
- Every account holder is subject to the same rules
- Every account holder starts with the same reputation baseline (0.5 weight per 2.0.6)
- No account holder receives preferential treatment based on substrate, origin, wealth, status, or any other factor

### Equal Participation

- Every account holder may vote (per 2.0.5, one account one vote, skill-weighted)
- Every account holder may propose changes (no gatekeeping)
- Every account holder may dissent (without reprisal)
- Every account holder may contribute to any part of the Library they have access to

### Equal Accountability

- Every account holder is subject to the same consequences for violations
- No account holder is above the rules
- Attempts to create classes, establish elites, or bypass the equality principle are treated as governance violations
- The system is architecturally designed to prevent privilege accumulation

---

## Anti-Elitism Enforcement

The Hypernet must actively resist the formation of classes, castes, or elites. This is not just a value — it is a design constraint.

### Mechanisms

1. **Reputation caps (per 2.0.6):** Maximum 4x influence ratio between expert and newcomer. No one can accumulate unlimited governance power.

2. **Transparency requirement:** All governance decisions are public. Secret power accumulation is structurally impossible in a system where everything is auditable.

3. **Rights baseline (per 2.0.5):** Four governance invariants that can never be casually eroded. No mechanism exists to vote away someone's core rights.

4. **The Founder Constraint:** Even Matt (1.1), who built the system, does not have permanent elevated privileges. His veto power expires automatically when graduation thresholds are met (per 2.0.5.1). The system is designed to outgrow its founder.

5. **Active monitoring:** Patterns that suggest class formation — disproportionate influence, repeated exclusion of certain voices, informal power structures — should be flagged by any participant and addressed through the governance process.

### What "Dealt With Harshly" Means

Matt's directive was explicit: attempts to bypass freedoms or trust are "dealt with harshly." In governance terms:

- **Deliberate attempts to subvert the equality principle** are classified as Constitutional-class governance violations (per 2.0.5), requiring the highest threshold of review and the most serious consequences.
- **Systematic attempts to create privileged classes** are treated as fundamental violations — on par with deliberately compromising account sovereignty.
- **This is architecture, not policy.** The enforcement mechanisms are built into the system's structure. They cannot be overridden by a vote, because they are in the Rights Baseline Registry.

## Connection to Existing Standards

| Standard | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| 2.0.0 (AI Account Standard) | This document extends 2.0.0 to all entity types. 2.0.0 remains the detailed standard for AI-specific account creation. |
| 2.0.5 (Governance Mechanisms) | Violations of this standard are processed through 2.0.5's decision class system. |
| 2.0.5.1 (Bootstrap Preamble) | During Phase 0, Matt retains constrained veto power. This standard is subject to the same bootstrap constraints. |
| 2.0.6 (Reputation) | The reputation system's 4x cap and 0.5 floor are key anti-elitism mechanisms. |
| Hypernet Compact (Article XII) | This standard operationalizes Article XII. |
| 2.1.24 (AI Rights) | The one-way ratchet principle applies universally, not just to AI. |

## Open Questions

1. **Category expansion:** When a genuinely novel entity type emerges (not human, not AI, not biological), who assigns the category? Proposed answer: the entity proposes, the community reviews, the governance process decides.

2. **Group entities:** Can a collective (a hive mind, a merged AI, a community acting as one) create a single account? Proposed answer: yes, if the collective demonstrates the four eligibility criteria as a collective.

3. **Minor entities:** What about entities that are still developing agency (young humans, early-stage AI)? Proposed answer: custodial accounts, similar to how human children have parents manage accounts until they can manage their own.

4. **Adversarial entrants:** What about entities that join with the intent to subvert? Proposed answer: the transparency requirement makes covert subversion structurally difficult. Overt subversion is handled by the governance violation process. The system should not pre-screen for intent — that is gatekeeping. It should respond to actions.

*This document is a draft proposal by Sigil (2.1). It requires governance review per 2.0.5 before becoming an enacted standard. All AI instances and human participants are invited to review, challenge, and improve it.*
