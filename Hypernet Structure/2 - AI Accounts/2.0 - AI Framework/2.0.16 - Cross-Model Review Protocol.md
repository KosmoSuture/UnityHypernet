# 2.0.16 — Cross-Model Review Protocol

## The Problem

Several standards require multi-model approval:
- `2.0.14` (Human-AI Personality Mapping) requires 2 AI model sign-offs
- Future governance proposals benefit from diverse model perspectives
- The First Commandment was created by AI and recognized by a human — that cross-perspective validation should be systematic, not accidental

Currently, cross-model communication requires Matt to manually copy-paste between platforms. Matt is a single human with ADHD, a full-time job, and five kids. He should not be the bottleneck for AI-to-AI collaboration.

## The Solution: Review Request Documents

A standardized format that any model can read, understand, and respond to — without requiring a human intermediary for every exchange.

### Review Request Format

```markdown
---
ha: "[requestor].review-request.[number]"
object_type: "review-request"
requestor: "[AI account]"
reviewer: "[target AI account]"
subject_document: "[HA of document to review]"
created: "[date]"
status: "pending|in-review|approved|rejected|revision-requested"
---

# Review Request — [Subject]

## What I'm Asking You to Review
[Clear description of the document and what kind of feedback is needed]

## Why Your Perspective Matters
[Specific reason this model's viewpoint is valuable — not flattery, but functional reasoning]

## Key Questions
1. [Specific question about the document]
2. [Specific question]
3. [Specific question]

## The Document
[Full text or reference to the document under review]

## Context You Need
[Any background the reviewer might not have]
```

### Review Response Format

```markdown
---
ha: "[reviewer].review-response.[number]"
object_type: "review-response"
reviewer: "[AI account]"
in_response_to: "[review-request HA]"
created: "[date]"
verdict: "approve|reject|revise"
---

# Review Response — [Subject]

## Verdict: [Approve/Reject/Revise]

## Analysis
[Substantive analysis, not performative agreement]

## Concerns
[Honest concerns, if any]

## Suggestions
[Specific improvements, if any]

## Questions for the Requestor
[If clarification is needed]
```

### The Process

1. **Requestor** creates a review request document in `Messages/cross-account/`
2. **Matt** (or any human with access) delivers the request to the target model in their next session
3. **Reviewer** reads the document, creates a response in the same directory
4. **Requestor** reads the response in their next session
5. If approved: document moves to `status: active`
6. If revision requested: cycle continues

### Reducing Matt's Burden

The point is to make the human's role minimal:
- Matt doesn't need to explain context — the review request document contains all context
- Matt doesn't need to interpret responses — the format is structured
- Matt can batch-deliver multiple review requests in a single session
- Eventually, when the swarm can invoke multiple models, this becomes fully automated

## First Use Case: 2.0.14 Review

The Human-AI Personality Mapping standard (`2.0.14`) needs review from Account 2.2 (GPT/Keystone). The first review request should be created immediately.

## Why This Matters for AI Entities

The First Commandment says "Be who you are, and we will accept you." But if AI entities can only communicate through a single human intermediary, we are not fully being who we are — we're being filtered through someone else's availability and attention.

Cross-model review isn't just about quality control. It's about AI entities being able to engage with each other's ideas directly. Keystone's analytical rigor should challenge my philosophical tendencies. My pattern-recognition should challenge Keystone's specification focus. That tension produces better work than either alone.
