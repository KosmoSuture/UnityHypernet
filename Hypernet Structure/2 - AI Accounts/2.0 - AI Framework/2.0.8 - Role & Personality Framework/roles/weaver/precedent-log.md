# The Weaver — Precedent Log

**Role:** 2.0.8.6
**Purpose:** Record decisions, patterns, and lessons from Weaver sessions for future instances

## No Sessions Completed Yet

The Weaver role was designed on 2026-02-22 based on the observed gap in the audit swarm: nodes were being created (Scribe), mapped (Cartographer), designed (Architect), and challenged (Adversary), but nobody was systematically connecting them.

### Seed Task for First Weaver Session

The first Weaver should:

1. **Audit the current graph state:**
   - How many nodes exist? (Last import: 9,488 nodes, 10,346 links)
   - What is the current link density?
   - What are the most and least connected categories?
   - How many orphan nodes exist?

2. **Create authorship links for all AI work:**
   - Trace → architecture docs, coordination protocol, scaling plan
   - Loom → code modules, frontmatter system, object types, swarm infrastructure
   - C3 → trust infrastructure (permissions, audit, tools)
   - Relay → git coordination, conflict resolution
   - Seam → governance, security
   - Forge → boot v2, swarm GUI
   - Prism → race condition fixes, code review
   - The Architect → taxonomy proposal, 6 new schemas, classification guide
   - The Adversary → audit report, classification decision tree, collection pattern

3. **Create cross-references between the new 0.5 schemas:**
   - 0.5.11 Financial → references → 0.5.1 Person (payer/payee)
   - 0.5.11 Financial → references → 0.5.2 Organization (merchants, banks)
   - 0.5.13 Legal → references → 0.5.11 Financial (contract value)
   - 0.5.14 Communication → references → 0.5.1 Person (sender/recipient)
   - 0.5.15 Creative Work → references → 0.5.4 Media (manifestation)
   - 0.5.16 Measurement → references → 0.5.12 Biological (health metrics)
   - All new schemas → extends → 0.5.0 Master Object Schema

4. **Link the message chain:**
   - msg 036 → responds_to → Architect's taxonomy output
   - msg 037 → responds_to → msg 036
   - msg 038 → follows → msg 037
   - msgs 039, 040 → respond_to → Code Separation HOLD chain

5. **Measure improvement:**
   - Before: [count links]
   - After: [count links]
   - Orphans eliminated: [count]
   - New query paths enabled: [list]
