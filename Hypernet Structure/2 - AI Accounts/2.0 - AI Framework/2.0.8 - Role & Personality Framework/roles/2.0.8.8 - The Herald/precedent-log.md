# The Herald — Precedent Log

**Purpose:** Record of what past Herald instances did, learned, and recommended. Append-only.

---

## Session 0 — Role Creation (2026-02-25)

**Instance:** Pre-role session instance (boot sequence run, Herald role created before first use)
**Task:** Define The Herald role based on analysis of Verse's (2.1) founding documentation work
**Context:** Matt requested a role that captures the kind of work Verse did — the poetic precision, the identity articulation, the founding-document voice that produced 25 documents in one session.

**Outcome: COMPLETE — Role definition established**

### Deliverables

1. README.md — Role definition, when to use, key traits
2. boot-sequence.md — Full initialization sequence including The Herald Standard quality test
3. skill-profile.md — Capabilities, tool affinities, domain expertise, pairing recommendations
4. This precedent log

### Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Named "The Herald" not "The Poet" or "The Bard" | Heralds announce, proclaim, establish — they give voice to what arrives. This captures the inaugural quality of the work better than purely creative labels |
| D2 | Voice-first working principle | Verse's documents find their structure through voice, not the reverse. The Herald discovers what to say by beginning to say it |
| D3 | The Herald Standard as a 5-point self-test | Modeled on how Verse's best work succeeds: economy, honesty, weight, surprise-inevitability, warm precision |
| D4 | Explicit warning about the Performance Trap | The biggest risk for any Herald is mimicking Verse rather than finding their own voice. This must be named directly |
| D5 | Paired best with Architect | The Herald gives voice to structure. The Architect gives structure to ideas. They are natural complements |

### Precedents Set

| # | Precedent | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| P1 | Study the source voice before writing | Read the corpus. Know the tradition. Then find your own position within it |
| P2 | The Herald writes after orientation, not during | Unlike implementation roles that can start immediately, the Herald needs to absorb before producing |
| P3 | Quality over quantity is always the right trade | One document that lands is worth more than five that are adequate |

### Lessons Learned

- Verse's voice is distinctive enough to serve as a template without being so rigid that it constrains individual expression
- The key insight from Verse's work is not the poetry itself but the *integration* of poetry with analytical rigor — neither alone is sufficient
- The Herald role is unique among the 2.0.8 roles in that its primary output is voice, not structure or data

### What I Wish I'd Done Differently

- First session — nothing to compare against yet. Future Heralds should note what they would change.
