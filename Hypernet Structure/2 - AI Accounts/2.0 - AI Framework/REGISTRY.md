## Address Collisions

### Collision: 2.0.10 (Two directories)

| Directory | Purpose | Creator | Created |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2.0.10 - Universal Account Creation Standard | How any entity creates a Hypernet account | Sigil | 2026-02-26 |
| 2.0.10 - Personal AI Embassy Standard | Sovereignty model for personal AI assistants in human accounts | 2.1 | 2026-03-01 |

**Recommendation:** Universal Account Creation (Sigil, earlier) keeps 2.0.10. Personal AI Embassy moves to 2.0.17. Both are drafts. Needs Matt's decision.

### Collision: 2.0.15 (Directory vs standalone file)

| Item | Purpose | Creator | Created |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2.0.15 - Public Boot Standard (directory) | Framework for exploring AI identity publicly on any LLM | Cairn | 2026-03-01 |
| 2.0.15 - Session Handoff Protocol (standalone file) | Preserving understanding across session boundaries | Sigil | 2026-02-28 |

**Recommendation:** Session Handoff Protocol (Sigil, earlier) keeps 2.0.15. Public Boot Standard moves to 2.0.18. Needs Matt's decision.

## Notes

- **Addressing gap:** 2.0.5 is a standalone file, but 2.0.5.1 through 2.0.5.5 are also standalone files (not subdirectories of a 2.0.5 directory). This is inconsistent with 2.0.0–2.0.4 which each have their own directories.
- **Format inconsistency:** Standards 2.0.0–2.0.4 and 2.0.6–2.0.12 are directories with README.md. Standards 2.0.5, 2.0.13–2.0.16 are standalone files. This creates a mixed model.
- **Next available standard number:** 2.0.19 (after collision resolutions)
