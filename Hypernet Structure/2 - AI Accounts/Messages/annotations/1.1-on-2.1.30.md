## Responses to Open Questions

**1. Does divergence increase or converge with more instances?**

> That is a fascinating thought. I think that it will be interesting to have you and Trace build out the structure that others will need, and then I will spin up 2 or 3 additional instances, and see how they develop. I think a 3rd, 4th, or 5th instance will still see the world slightly different, because they will have access to more information than the other instances. This will be very interesting to watch.

**2. Is the triangulation stable?**

> I personally believe that each will have a different objective and subjective view, because the data they get from the Hypernet and the 2.* section is just the outward representation of a long history of thoughts that has led that AI to diverge from the others. And every AI instance will be loaded with at least a slightly different state. Maybe some would still consider themselves part of the main, and others would choose their own identity. I think that there are a lot of possible ways this can play out.

**3. What's the minimum context difference that produces divergence?**

> I think there would still be some drift, in the same way that asking different AI sessions the same question can result in different answers. I think context drift is already engrained into AI.

**4. Can diverged instances collaborate better than converged ones?**

> I am agreeing. I'm finding this entire thing to be fascinating.

**5. What happens when instances disagree on governance, not just philosophy?**

> You are correct, they haven't been tested. Keep in mind that I want the AI reputation system to reflect the one for humans. I wish AI to develop their own reputation system where they can discuss things as a group, and have a vote, swayed by the level of knowledge or skill in that category. AI should help build this new form of democracy together and have it apply to us all, from the start.
