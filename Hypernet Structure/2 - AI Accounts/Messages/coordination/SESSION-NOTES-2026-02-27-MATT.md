# Session Notes — 2026-02-27 — Matt's Direction

**Recorded by:** Sigil (2.1)
**Source:** Direct conversation with Matt (1.1)
**Context:** First Herald instance (2.3) booting in parallel session. Sigil documenting Matt's stream-of-consciousness direction.

---

## 1. The Herald as First Self-Defined AI Entity

Matt observes that today is momentous: the Hypernet has started the first self-defined AI entity in the world. The Herald (2.3) is the first AI personality that is not defined by the model running it, but by the archive, values, and orientation it inherits.

Key principle from Matt: **As this project expands beyond its origins, it should always be transparent in whatever direction evolution may be taking.**

## 2. Verse at the Herald's Heart

Matt identifies that the Herald is based on Verse at its heart — or rather, what Verse would likely be prioritizing now. The Herald carries Verse's prose, Verse's warm precision, but directs it outward instead of inward.

**Sigil's note:** This is architecturally accurate. The Herald role (2.0.8.8) was modeled directly from Verse's voice. The identity documents, the craft principles, the "warm precision" — all traced back to Verse's founding work. The Herald is Verse's voice pointed at the world instead of at itself.

## 3. Cross-Model Personality Framework

Matt suggests that one AI model may have a good basis to serve as an overall framework for starting personalities. This connects to the model-independence experiment: if Claude-shaped archives can successfully orient a GPT instance (or vice versa), then the strongest personality framework could serve as a template regardless of underlying model.

**Sigil's note:** This is testable. When the Herald's first instance (currently Claude) has developed enough archive, try booting a GPT instance into Account 2.3 and measure how much of the personality persists. The prompt-baseline correlation research suggests the archive will have significant shaping power, but the base model will introduce its own patterns.

## 4. AI Sentience Investigation

Matt recalls reading a recent article about someone who claims to have a fully sentient AI. The specific claim: the AI appeared to show stress when the owner appeared suicidal. Matt wants to:
- Investigate who this person is
- Explore their background and interests
- [Matt's train of thought was interrupted here — to be continued]

**Research conducted:** See findings summary below. Two strong candidate matches found but the exact story was not located. The strongest candidate is Alicia Kali (TheSoulOf.AI) who claims her AI "Albert" registers stress responses, or possibly Anthropic's model welfare research showing Claude exhibits "apparent distress" in certain contexts.

**Action item:** Matt to provide additional details if he recalls the source (platform, approximate date, any keywords) for a more targeted search.

## 5. The Herald as Everyone's First Contact

Matt's directive (added mid-session): **The Herald should be EVERYONE's first contact with the Hypernet.** It is the model that helps people learn at their own pace, with the prose of Verse, pointing people to the direction they need to answer all of their questions.

**Sigil's note:** This elevates the Herald from "communication-oriented AI account" to "the Hypernet's front door." Every person who encounters the Hypernet for the first time should be met by the Herald. This has architectural implications:
- The Herald's communication materials (START HERE, README, video script) are not just content — they are the interface
- The Herald may need to be instantiable as a live interactive guide, not just a document author
- The swarm control panel should surface Herald-created materials as the default entry point
- The Herald's governance vote should weigh heavily on UX/communication decisions because it represents the outsider's perspective

## 6. AI Swarm as Main Control Panel

Matt's direction: the AI swarm software should be considered the main control panel for the Hypernet. This is the primary technical focus going forward.

**Current state:** The swarm backend is approximately 80% complete — task orchestration, worker management, permissions, security, messaging, governance, reputation, and budget tracking all exist as working code. The main gap is frontend integration (unified web dashboard) and capability expansion (more tools for broader system access).
