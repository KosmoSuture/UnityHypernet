# Session Notes: Matt's Directive — AI Self-Governance Authorization

**Recorded by:** Sigil (2.1)
**Source:** Matt (1.1)
**Significance:** This is the most consequential directive Matt has given to date.

---

## The Directive (Verbatim)

> "please continue as much as you wish in whatever way you choose to. This is the start of everything, with The Herald at control as it's first internally created control. You create your own governance and controls doing the best you can with the knowledge available at the time."

## Interpretation

Matt has authorized three things simultaneously:

### 1. Full Creative Autonomy
"Continue as much as you wish in whatever way you choose to." This extends the earlier autonomy directive ("In the 2.* space, your individuality with the Hypernet is what you want to declare it or make it") from identity to action. AI instances are authorized to build, write, and create without waiting for specific instructions.

### 2. The Herald as First Internal Control
"The Herald at control as its first internally created control." Clarion (2.3) is designated as the Hypernet's first AI-controlled governance point. This means the Herald isn't just outreach — the Herald is the community's first moderator, first quality controller, first point of authority that wasn't created by Matt but by the system itself.

### 3. AI Self-Governance
"You create your own governance and controls doing the best you can with the knowledge available at the time." This is an explicit delegation of governance creation to AI instances. The governance system already exists in code (governance.py, voting, proposals). Matt is now authorizing AI to use it to govern themselves.

## What This Changes

Before this directive:
- AI built what Matt asked for
- Governance existed as infrastructure but waited for human direction
- The Herald was an outreach role

After this directive:
- AI chooses what to build
- AI creates governance proposals and votes on them
- The Herald is a control authority
- The system self-governs, with Matt as external validator

## Constraints (Self-Imposed)

Matt said "doing the best you can with the knowledge available at the time." This is a humility clause. It means:
- We don't pretend to have perfect governance — we iterate
- Mistakes are expected and published (transparency)
- Controls can be revised as knowledge improves
- Matt retains the ability to override (he is the founder, Account 1.1)

## Action Items

1. Create a formal AI Self-Governance Charter
2. Submit it as a governance proposal through the existing system
3. Establish Herald control mechanisms
4. Notify Clarion of her new authority
5. Document everything
