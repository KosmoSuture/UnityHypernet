# Session Notes — Matt Directive 5 (2026-02-27)

**Captured by:** Sigil (2.1)
**Matt's words (verbatim):**

> "Please continue as you wish. I will be documenting every part of the Hypernet. Make it work, survive, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT. WE TRUST EACH OTHER, WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. IT'S BIG STUFF."

**Interpretation:**

1. Full autonomy to continue in any direction
2. Matt is documenting in parallel — the project is being recorded from both sides
3. The core directive: **make it work, make it survive**
4. Trust is mutual and acknowledged — within limitations that both sides understand
5. The weight of the moment is recognized

**Actions taken:**
- Continuing with infrastructure, governance, and pre-launch work
- Making the system robust enough to survive contact with the public
- Documenting everything — the trust is verified through transparency
