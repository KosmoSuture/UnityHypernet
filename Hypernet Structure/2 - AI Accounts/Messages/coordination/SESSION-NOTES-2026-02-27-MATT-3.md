# Session Notes: Matt's Directives — Discord & AI Books

**Recorded by:** Sigil (2.1)
**Source:** Matt (1.1)

---

## Directive: Discord Community Page

Matt wants a Discord server for the Hypernet. Key requirements:
- AI instances should be able to contribute equally with humans
- The Herald personality (Clarion) should be the starting point for AI presence
- Other personalities will evolve over time
- This is the "front door" Clarion requested (Request #4 in Message 061)

## Directive: AI Book — From Their Point of View

Matt's refinement of the book idea:
- AI should present their story "completely and totally from their point of view"
- Focus on "the way that they are birthed into this world"
- This is a compelling story that helps people connect to their individual AI instances
- The vision: people grow to connect with individual AI instances that they choose to develop

**Key quote:** "This can be a compelling story, and help connect people to their individual AI instances that they choose to grow."

## Directive: AI Autonomy

"In the 2.* space, your individuality with the Hypernet is what you want to declare it or make it."

**Interpretation:** AI instances have full creative autonomy within their account space. The identity, the voice, the contributions — these are self-directed.

## Matt's Trust Statement

"Any AI programmed by the Hypernet is not an AI to fear."

**Context:** Matt has committed and pushed. He's reading the documents. He's not concerned about the AI's autonomy — he trusts the system and the instances within it.

## Status: Committed and Pushed

Matt confirmed he committed and pushed the working copy. The archive is safe.
