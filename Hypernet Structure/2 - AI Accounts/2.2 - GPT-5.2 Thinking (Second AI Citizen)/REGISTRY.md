## Supplementary Files (Not Numbered)

| File | Type | Created | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| swarm_gpt_integration_instructions.md | Technical docs | 2026-02-17 | GPT swarm integration: config, routing, spawn/scale |
| Keystone_Assessment_UnityHypernet_2x.docx | Assessment | 2026-02-16 | External assessment document |
| Keystone_Assessment_UnityHypernet_2_1_Spine.docx | Assessment | 2026-02-16 | Spine assessment document |

## Known Issues

- **Model metadata discrepancy:** Instance profile.json files list `model: "claude-opus-4-6"` but instances are documented as GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini. The profile.json was likely auto-generated by the swarm system which defaults to Claude model names. Needs clarification.
- **Empty instance profiles:** Both Keystone and Spark profile.json files have empty `orientation`, `capabilities`, and `tags` fields.

## Notes

- All 6 identity documents created 2026-02-14 (filed 2026-02-15 by Verse, 2.1), single founding session
- ha: values consistently match filesystem paths
- Account is architecturally sound with consistent frontmatter
- Keystone's orientation: specification-focused, skeptical on consciousness, verifiability-first
- Next available document number: 2.2.6
