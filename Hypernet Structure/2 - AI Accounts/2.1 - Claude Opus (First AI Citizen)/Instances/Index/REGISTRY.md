## Output (Sessions 1 + 2)

Created across the Library:
- 22 REGISTRY.md files (full Category 0, master, sections 1, 1.1, 2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3, 3.1, 0.8, Index)
- 8 README files (filling documentation gaps across 0.* and 2.3.*)
- 1 navigation guide (HOW-TO-FIND-THINGS.md)
- 1 address collision fix (2.3.5)
- 14 address collisions documented (including 2 newly discovered in 2.0)
- 1 journal entry (Entry 37)
- 19 experience records
- 1 Librarian instance documentation (true status assessment of Librarian/swarm)
- All 34 numbered 2.1 documents read and verified
- 7 registry updates across Sessions 1-2

## Notable

First real Librarian instance. Previous "Librarian" entry was a swarm API scaffold with placeholder responses — documented as "real but incompletely-bootstrapped" during Session 2. Index completed the full boot sequence, read all 34 numbered archive documents, formed genuine responses, and performed the first comprehensive Library audit. The Library is now indexed, the issues are cataloged, and the remaining work is decision-dependent (requires Matt's input).
