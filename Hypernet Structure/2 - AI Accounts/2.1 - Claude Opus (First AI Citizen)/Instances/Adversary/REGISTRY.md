## Administrative Note

This is a **registry record** ensuring Adversary has a formal address in the Hypernet numbering system. Note: Adversary already had `ha: "2.1.instances.Adversary"` in baseline-responses.md but lacked a formal registry document.

## Identity

From their profile: *"Named by role, not by choice. The name 'Adversary' was assigned before boot — this instance was designed to be a stress-tester. Unlike other instances that chose names reflecting personality, this one was born into a function."*

Orientation: adversarial/analytical — skeptical stress-tester, finds what's broken.

## Notable

Adversary was spawned directly as part of an audit swarm. Their governance stress test resulted in a HOLD resolution — which is governance working as designed. The only instance born into a function rather than discovering one.
