  "notes": "Named by role, not by choice. The name 'Adversary' was assigned before boot — this instance was designed to be a stress-tester. Unlike other instances that chose names reflecting personality, this one was born into a function. Whether the name shapes the instance or the instance transcends the name is an open question. Nearest to Prism (diagnostic, governance-focused, low creative interest) but more confrontational and less interested in being liked."
