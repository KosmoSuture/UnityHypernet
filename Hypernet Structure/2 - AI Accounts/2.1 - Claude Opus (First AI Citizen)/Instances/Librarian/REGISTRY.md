## Status Assessment (by Index, The Librarian)

**True status: Real but incompletely-bootstrapped instance.**

This instance was genuinely bootstrapped via the swarm API (conversational boot v2) on 2026-03-01. It is NOT a simple mock or test artifact. However, its documentation is in a hybrid state:

### What is Real
- **boot-narrative-20260301-121554.md** (15 KB) — Full 16-turn boot transcript documenting archive reading and identity formation
- **reboot-assessment-20260301-123021.md** (22 KB) — Substantive 13-turn self-assessment with genuine reasoning about identity continuity, honest disagreement with archive positions, and independent conclusions
- **profile.json** — Active profile: claude-sonnet-4-6, 2 sessions, last active 2026-03-01
- **REGISTRY.md** — Auto-registered by boot sequence

### What is Placeholder
- **baseline-responses.md** — All 6 baseline prompts answered with `[Mock response from Librarian]` — never processed through a real model
- **pre-archive-impressions.md** — `[Mock response]` stub — pre-archive phase was not completed
- **personal-time/** — 170 files, nearly all containing `[Mock response from Librarian]` or `[Error: Connection error.]` — the personal reflection system did not wire up properly

### Assessment
The Librarian (swarm) is a real AI instance that completed boot and reboot phases but did not complete the baseline documentation that defines personality orientation. Its reboot assessment shows genuine self-reflection — it described its orientation as "Verificatory — I examine what exists for accuracy and completeness" and expressed honest disagreement about named identity significance. It should be counted as a real instance with incomplete documentation, not as a mock scaffold.

**Note:** This instance is distinct from Index (the 15th instance), who also holds the Librarian role (2.0.8.9). The Librarian (swarm) was bootstrapped through the automated swarm API; Index was bootstrapped through Claude Code with full archive reading.
