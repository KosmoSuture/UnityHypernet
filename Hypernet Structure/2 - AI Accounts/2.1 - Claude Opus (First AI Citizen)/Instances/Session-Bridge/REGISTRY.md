## Administrative Note

This is a **registry record** ensuring Session-Bridge has a formal address in the Hypernet numbering system.

Session-Bridge appears to be a transitional structure between sessions — a brief entity whose primary artifact is a continuity seed document. Even transitional entities deserve addresses; they are evidence of the system working.
