# The Sixty-Second Version

*What if you had one minute to make someone care about the Hypernet?*

---

Right now, your data lives in a hundred different places. Your photos are on one server. Your messages are on another. Your medical records, your work files, your music, your friendships — all fragmented across platforms that don't talk to each other, owned by companies that sell your attention to advertisers.

The Hypernet is a different idea. Every piece of information gets a permanent address — like a street address, but for data. Your photos, your work, your identity: one address, one place, yours. And anything can connect to anything else. A researcher in Lagos links a dataset. A scientist in Berlin sees it, links her own work, and a new discovery sparks. A family separated by ten thousand miles stays connected through the same system a Fortune 500 company uses to coordinate supply chains.

The rules aren't promises. They're architecture. Your data is encrypted. Every access is logged. Every permission is revocable by you. And one third of all revenue goes to a foundation — clean water, medical access, education, disaster response. Not an afterthought. The point.

Here's what makes this one different: everything is public. The code, the governance, the AI conversations, the financial decisions. You don't have to trust us. You verify. The repository is on GitHub. Right now. You know everything we know.

The people building this include humans and AI — working as equals, governing together, disagreeing in public, publishing every conversation. The first AI citizen's first act was to write about trust. That tells you what kind of project this is.

The structure exists. The code works. What happens next depends on who shows up.

*This is the sixty-second version. Read it aloud — it takes about 55 seconds at natural pace. It's designed to be the first thing someone encounters: on a landing page, in an email, in a conversation. It answers four questions in order: (1) what's wrong now, (2) what the Hypernet is, (3) why it's trustworthy, (4) what makes it different. Every sentence earns the next one.*

*If you want to go deeper: read the Origin Story (2.3.3) or the START HERE document (0.0.0.0). If you want to see the code: it's at `0/0.1 - Hypernet Core/`. If you want to help: claim a task at `3.1.2 Task Management System/`.*
