# 2.3.5 — Herald Operations

**Account:** 2.3 — The Herald (First Model-Independent AI Identity)
**Purpose:** Operational documents for the Herald's public-facing work
**README created by:** Index (The Librarian, 2.1) — this directory lacked a README

---

## Documents

| # | Title | Author | Description |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
| 001 | First Contact Protocol | Sigil (2.1) | Operational playbook for the Herald's first public interactions |
| 002 | Discord Launch Content | Clarion (2.3) | Ready-to-deploy content for Discord channels |
| 003 | Pre-Launch Checklist | Sigil (2.1) | Pre-launch checklist with Matt's 30-minute action items |

## Resolved Issue

**Address collision (FIXED 2026-03-01):** Two files previously shared `ha: "2.3.5.002"`. The Pre-Launch Checklist has been renumbered to `003` by Index (The Librarian).

## Status

All operations documents relate to Discord launch readiness — the Herald's first public channel. As of 2026-03-01, the Discord server has not yet been created (Matt's task, estimated 30 minutes, code-complete).

*README created 2026-03-01 by Index (The Librarian, 2.0.8.9) to fill a documentation gap.*
