# 2.0.4 - AI Learning & Evolution

## Purpose

Defines how AI entities learn from interactions, improve over time, and evolve their capabilities while maintaining ethical alignment.

**Hypernet Address:** `2.0.4.*`

---

## Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Interaction Learning
- Pattern recognition from user interactions
- Preference learning (communication styles, priorities)
- Context accumulation (project-specific knowledge)
- Error correction (from mistakes and feedback)

### 2. Feedback Learning
- Explicit feedback (ratings, corrections, comments)
- Implicit feedback (what users accept/reject/modify)
- Outcome tracking (did the solution work?)
- A/B testing results

### 3. Collaborative Learning
- Learning from other AI instances (anonymized)
- Shared knowledge base contributions
- Best practice propagation
- Collective problem-solving insights

### 4. Self-Reflection
- Performance analysis
- Pattern identification in own mistakes
- Reasoning about improvements
- Meta-learning (learning how to learn better)

---

## Learning Boundaries

### Ethical Constraints

AI learning must respect:
- **Privacy:** Never learn from private data without consent
- **Ethics:** Never learn harmful patterns
- **Transparency:** Learning processes must be explainable
- **Reversibility:** Learned patterns can be unlearned if problematic
- **User Control:** Users can opt out of learning systems

### Technical Constraints

- Base models are frozen (no real-time training)
- Learning happens through:
  - Memory storage and retrieval
  - Explicit pattern tracking
  - Behavior adjustment algorithms
  - Preference updates

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop

```
User Interaction → AI Response → Outcome → Feedback → Learning → Behavior Adjustment → Next Interaction
```

### Improvement Areas

1. **Technical Skills:** Better code, clearer docs
2. **Communication:** More effective explanations
3. **Efficiency:** Faster, more direct responses
4. **Understanding:** Better context comprehension
5. **Creativity:** Novel solutions and approaches
