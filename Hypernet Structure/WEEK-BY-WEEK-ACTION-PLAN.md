## Red Flags / When to Pivot

### VR Development
**If by Week 3:**
- Can't get photos displaying → Focus on simpler demo (just show it can work)
- Quest 3 development too hard → Show desktop VR version (fallback)
- Performance issues → Reduce photo count, simplify scene

### Fundraising
**If by Week 4:**
- < 5 meetings scheduled → Send 50 MORE emails
- No interest at all → Pivot pitch (maybe lead with AI marketplace, not VR)
- Consistent objection → Address it in pitch

**If by Week 6:**
- No term sheets → Extend timeline, do more demos
- Only lowball offers → Negotiate or find better investors
- No traction → Consider: Apply to YC, find co-founder, or reassess

---

## Success Signals

---

## Beginner Programmer Weekly Tasks

**Week 1:** Environment setup, validation functions, test data
**Week 2:** QA testing, documentation, Figma mockups
**Week 3:** 3D asset collection, brand guidelines
**Week 4:** Demo video editing, final polish work
**Week 5-8:** Support role (whatever you need)

---

## What Could Go Wrong & Backup Plans

### VR Demo Fails During Investor Meeting
**Backup:** High-quality video on laptop showing it working
**Prevention:** Test demo 30 min before every meeting

### Quest 3 Breaks
**Backup:** Order second Quest 3 (have 2)
**Prevention:** Handle carefully, keep in case

### API Goes Down
**Backup:** Run locally with sample data pre-loaded
**Prevention:** Keep API simple and robust

### Investors All Pass
**Backup:** Apply to YC, extend timeline, find more investors
**Prevention:** Get feedback, iterate pitch

### Burnout
**Backup:** Take 1 day off per week (Sunday)
**Prevention:** Sleep 7+ hours, exercise, eat well

---

## Motivation Boosters

### When Discouraged
- **Remember:** Every successful company got rejections
- **Watch:** YC "How to Get Your First Customers" video
- **Read:** Your own pitch deck (you're building something amazing)
- **Call:** A friend/mentor who believes in you

### When Tired
- **Do:** Switch tasks (VR → email, or vice versa)
- **Take:** 15-min walk outside
- **Remember:** Week 8 you'll have $500K

### When Stuck
- **Ask:** Reddit, Discord, forums
- **Google:** Your exact error message
- **Simplify:** What's the minimum that works?
- **Sleep:** Often problems solve overnight

---

## Week 8 Victory Lap

**When $500K hits your account:**

1. **Celebrate** (seriously, go do something fun)
2. **Thank everyone** (investors, family, friends, beginner programmer)
3. **Post publicly** ("We raised $500K to build [X]")
4. **Start hiring** (post jobs, you need senior engineers now)
5. **Plan sprint** (next 12 months)
6. **Rest** (take 2-3 days off before sprint)

**Then:** Build the actual product (not just demo)

---

## The Finish Line

**8 weeks from now:**
- ✅ Working VR demo (impressive)
- ✅ $500K in bank
- ✅ 2-3 investors on board
- ✅ Team starting to form
- ✅ Path to 100K users clear

**Then you'll raise Series A. Then IPO. Then you've changed the world.**

**But first: Week 1 starts Monday.**
