TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:                  Build Human Project Organization and Onboarding System

Description:            Create a clear, navigable project structure that allows
                        humans to easily find where they can contribute. The
                        current system is confusing for newcomers. Need a
                        hierarchical project/task tree with skill descriptions
                        so people can match their abilities to available work.

                        Must include upstream/downstream task linking so issues
                        can escalate up the tree. Copy-paste-ready documentation
                        with clear instructions for minimal human friction.

                        From Matt: "Things need to be better organized for the
                        humans using it to know what they can do. Right now, it
                        is very confusing... There needs to be a structure for
                        Projects, that goes all the way down the tree... There
                        needs to be a clear structure, and skill descriptions
                        that a person can navigate and find things they are
                        capable of helping with easily."

                        "There must be upstream and downstream conditions where
                        tasks can be linked to higher and higher levels of the
                        tree to get them taken care of at that level."

                        "Whatever their skills are, we want to point them to
                        where they can help."

Estimated Hours:        80

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Information Architecture
  - UX/UI Design
  - Technical Writing
  - Project Management
  - Skills Taxonomy Design
  - Documentation

Deliverables:
  1. Project hierarchy structure
     - Top-level project categories
     - Sub-project breakdown
     - Task tree that goes "all the way down"
     - Clear parent-child relationships
     - Visual navigation (tree view, search)

  2. Skills taxonomy and matching
     - Skills catalog (coding, design, email outreach, etc.)
     - Skill-to-task mapping
     - Difficulty levels per task
     - Time commitment indicators
     - "I can help with..." entry point

  3. Upstream/downstream task linking
     - Escalation pathways (task -> subtask -> sub-subtask)
     - Blocked-by / blocking relationships
     - Automatic escalation triggers
     - Status propagation up/down the tree

  4. Contributor onboarding flow
     - "Start here" guide
     - Skill self-assessment
     - Task recommendation engine
     - Copy-paste-ready contribution guides
     - Minimal-friction first contribution path
     - Progress tracking for contributors

  5. Documentation standards
     - Every task has clear instructions
     - Acceptance criteria are human-readable
     - Examples provided for complex tasks
     - Templates for common task types

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] New contributor can find suitable work in <5 minutes
  - [ ] Skills taxonomy covers all current task types
  - [ ] Upstream/downstream links work for escalation
  - [ ] All documentation is copy-paste ready
  - [ ] Task tree is navigable and searchable
  - [ ] Tested with actual humans for usability

Due Date:               [TBD - High priority for growth]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours
  - Estimated: 80+ hours

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - "There are so many tasks that people could help with, even if it's
    just sending emails to different people, or finding ways to expand
    the awareness, maybe coding or design." — Matt
  - Recent copy-paste-ready docs were a good step forward
  - This overlaps with Tasks 003 and 012 but is more comprehensive
  - Skills matching is key: people need to find their fit quickly
