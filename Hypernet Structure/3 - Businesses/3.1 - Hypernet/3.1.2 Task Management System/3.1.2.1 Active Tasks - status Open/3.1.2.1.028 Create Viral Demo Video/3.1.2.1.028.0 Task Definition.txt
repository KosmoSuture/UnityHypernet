TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA

Title:                  Create Viral Demo Video

Description:            Produce a compelling demonstration video that showcases
                        the Hypernet's VR experience and sparks viral awareness.
                        The video should show the experience from the perspective
                        of a user wearing VR headsets or glasses, demonstrating
                        what the Hypernet will be capable of.

                        An existing production guide and script exists at:
                        DEMO-VIDEO-PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md (in Planning & Documentation).
                        This is a 90-second "Remember Everything" concept with
                        a full 19-scene storyboard using Runway ML prompts.

                        From Matt: "The video that I want to spark this off as
                        viral needs to be created. If the script I was working
                        on for that project isn't in your available documents,
                        you can use that as a draft and improve on it."

                        "Preferably one that demonstrates itself and shows what
                        it will be capable of, as if from a user wearing VR
                        headsets or glasses."
