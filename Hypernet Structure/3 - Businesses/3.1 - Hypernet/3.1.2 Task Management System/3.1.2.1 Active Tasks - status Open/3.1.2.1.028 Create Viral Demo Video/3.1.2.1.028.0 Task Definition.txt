TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA

Title:                  Create Viral Demo Video

Description:            Produce a compelling demonstration video that showcases
                        the Hypernet's VR experience and sparks viral awareness.
                        The video should show the experience from the perspective
                        of a user wearing VR headsets or glasses, demonstrating
                        what the Hypernet will be capable of.

                        An existing production guide and script exists at:
                        DEMO-VIDEO-PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md (in Planning & Documentation).
                        This is a 90-second "Remember Everything" concept with
                        a full 19-scene storyboard using Runway ML prompts.

                        From Matt: "The video that I want to spark this off as
                        viral needs to be created. If the script I was working
                        on for that project isn't in your available documents,
                        you can use that as a draft and improve on it."

                        "Preferably one that demonstrates itself and shows what
                        it will be capable of, as if from a user wearing VR
                        headsets or glasses."

Comments/Updates:
  - Script and Runway ML prompts already exist — start from there
  - VR perspective is key — viewer should feel like they're wearing a headset
  - Goal is VIRAL — quality and "wow factor" are paramount
  - Multiple platform versions needed (vertical for TikTok, widescreen for YouTube)
  - This is a top awareness priority
  - [2026-02-26] Matt's key directive: human connection is the HEART of the video,
    not the technology. Relationships across the globe, research explosion,
    universal equality, and "YOU are the most important part."
  - [2026-02-26] Collaborative production model: team creates individual versions,
    compares, combines best elements. WhatsApp (Spanish team) + Discord (community).
