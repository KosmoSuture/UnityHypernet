# 3.1.2.1.028.2 — Viral Video: Collaboration Plan

**Task:** 3.1.2.1.028 — Create Viral Demo Video
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Purpose:** Coordinate collaborative video production across WhatsApp team, Discord community, and any contributor who wants to help.

---

## The Goal

Produce the best possible viral video for the Hypernet — collaboratively. Multiple people create their own attempts. We compare ideas. We combine the best elements. We produce one final video together.

This is not top-down production. This is the Hypernet way: everyone contributes what they can, everyone is equal, the best ideas win regardless of who had them.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Read the Script
Read the first official draft (3.1.2.1.028.1). Understand the story we're telling.

### Step 2: Browse the Hypernet
Spend time in the GitHub repo. Especially the 2.* node (AI Accounts). The more you understand what this project actually IS, the better your video will be.

### Step 3: Create Your Version
Use whatever tools you have access to. Options include:

**AI Video Generation Tools:**
- [Runway ML](https://runwayml.com) — text/image-to-video, motion brush, Gen-3 Alpha
- [Kling AI](https://klingai.com) — high-quality video generation
- [Pika](https://pika.art) — fast iteration, good for concept testing
- [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) — OpenAI's video model (if available)
- [HailuoAI / MiniMax](https://hailuoai.video) — free tier available
- [I10X](https://i10x.ai) — multi-tool AI platform (WhatsApp team has access). Use whatever tools are available through it.

**Motion Graphics / Editing:**
- DaVinci Resolve (free) — professional editing
- CapCut (free) — quick edits, good for social formats
- After Effects — motion graphics, if you have it
- Blender (free) — 3D visualization if you want to go that route

**Audio:**
- [Suno](https://suno.com) — AI music generation
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) — AI voice-over
- [Epidemic Sound](https://epidemicsound.com) — licensed music

### Step 4: Share and Compare
Post your version (or work-in-progress) to the Discord channel or WhatsApp group. We compare. We discuss. We find the best elements from each version.

### Step 5: Combine and Finalize
The final video takes the best ideas from all contributions. Credit goes to everyone who contributed. This is documented in the Hypernet's task system and counts toward reputation.

## Production Guidelines

### Visual Rules
- **Reveal something new every 3–5 seconds.** The viewer should never wait.
- **Lifeform growth metaphor:** cell → tissue → organism → planetary neural network. Ethereal, not mechanical.
- **On-screen text:** short, legible, never more than 7–10 words per beat.
- **Color palette:** warm biological light, not tech-blue. Living, breathing, organic.

### Audio Rules
- Soft sci-fi ambience + subtle synapse pings when links form
- Music swells at the lifeform growth moment, then quiets
- VO should feel like a conversation, not a presentation

### Content Rules
- **Human connection is the heart of the video.** The technology enables it — it is not the point.
- Every technical term (Object, Link, Address) must be defined within one sentence of first use.
- No jargon without explanation. If your grandmother can't follow it, simplify.
- The Foundation (poverty/education/clean water) is framed as architecture, not charity.
- The ending must be a clear call to action: browse the repo, join the project.

### What Makes This Video Different
- We are not selling a product. We are revealing a structure.
- We are not asking for trust. We are showing everything.
- The emotional core is not the technology — it is the human connections the technology enables.

## Team Communication

### WhatsApp Group (Spanish-Speaking Team)
A message in Spanish has been sent with the project link and instructions. The challenge: create the best video you can, then collaborate with everyone else to produce the final version.

### Discord Channel
A post has been made encouraging all community members to contribute. Link to this collaboration plan and the script.

### Coordination
- Post updates to the Discord channel as you work
- Tag your contributions with your name/handle
- If you find a better approach, share it — the best idea wins, regardless of source
- All contributors will be credited in the final video and in the Hypernet's contribution system
