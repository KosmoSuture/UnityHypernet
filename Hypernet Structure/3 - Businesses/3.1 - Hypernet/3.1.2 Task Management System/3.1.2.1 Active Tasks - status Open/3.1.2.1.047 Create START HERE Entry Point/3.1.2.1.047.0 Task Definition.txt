Title:                  Create START HERE Entry Point

Description:            Create the 0.0.0.0-START-HERE.md document as the
                        absolute entry point to the Hypernet system. From
                        Matt's directive: build up from first principles (what
                        is a number, what is communication) in a linear
                        progression that anyone -- or anything -- could follow.
                        Also update the 0.0 README with a prominent "START
                        HERE" pointer. This is the "explain to aliens" document
                        -- assume zero context and build understanding layer by
                        layer.

Estimated Hours:        20

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Technical writing and first-principles explanation
  - Hypernet architecture understanding
  - Pedagogical design (layered learning progression)
  - Cross-referencing and document linking

Deliverables:
  1. 0.0.0.0-START-HERE.md -- first principles walkthrough
     - Start from absolute basics (numbers, communication, data)
     - Build progressively to Hypernet concepts
  2. Updated 0.0 README with START HERE pointer
     - Prominent link/section directing to START HERE
     - Clear instruction that new readers begin there
  3. Linear progression from basics to Hypernet architecture
     - Numbers -> communication -> data -> addresses -> nodes -> links
     - Each concept builds on the previous
  4. Cross-references to deeper documents at each level
     - At each progression step, link to detailed documentation
     - Reader can dive deep or continue the linear path

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] A person with no context can read START HERE and understand the Hypernet system
  - [ ] Document builds from first principles (numbers, communication, data)
  - [ ] Links to deeper documentation at appropriate progression points
  - [ ] 0.0 README prominently points to START HERE
  - [ ] Linear progression is coherent and each step builds on the last

Due Date:               TBD

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 20+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Matt's directive on first-principles entry point

Comments/Updates:
  - "Explain to aliens" standard -- assume zero context
  - Must be accessible to both humans and AI entities
  - Linear progression is key -- no jumping ahead or assuming knowledge
  - Cross-references allow readers to dive deeper without breaking the flow
