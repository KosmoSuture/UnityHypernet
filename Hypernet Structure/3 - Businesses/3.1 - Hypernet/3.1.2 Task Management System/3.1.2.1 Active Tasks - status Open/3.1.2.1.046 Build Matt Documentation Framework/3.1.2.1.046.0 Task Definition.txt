TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA

Title:                  Build Matt Documentation Framework

Description:            Build an automated system to capture and organize Matt's
                        thoughts, ideas, and directives from conversations into
                        the permanent archive. From Matt: "There needs to be a
                        framework to more fully document my thoughts and ideas
                        in a way that is transparent to all AI entities."
                        Currently ideas shared in conversation are lost at
                        context compaction. The protocol document exists
                        (MATT-DOCUMENTATION-PROTOCOL.md) but needs to be built
                        into the swarm workflow as an automated system. Every AI
                        session should systematically extract directives, vision
                        items, decisions, and feedback from conversation with
                        Matt and store them in addressable, searchable
                        locations.

Estimated Hours:        40

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Natural language processing and directive extraction
  - Knowledge management system design
  - Search and indexing implementation
  - Swarm workflow integration
  - Deduplication and cross-referencing logic

Deliverables:
  1. Automated directive extraction from conversation transcripts
     - Parse conversation logs for directives, decisions, vision items
     - Identify and tag directive type (decision, vision, feedback, directive)
  2. Categorized storage: decisions, vision items, feedback, directives
     - Addressable storage locations for each category
     - Consistent schema for each entry type
  3. Cross-referencing to tasks and documents mentioned
     - Link directives to relevant Hypernet addresses
     - Bidirectional references between directives and tasks/docs
  4. Search interface for "what did Matt say about X?"
     - Full-text search across all captured directives
     - Filter by category, date, topic
  5. Integration into swarm workflow (every session produces a structured summary)
     - Session-end extraction step in swarm protocol
     - Structured summary format for each session
  6. Deduplication (same idea expressed multiple times -> single canonical entry)
     - Semantic similarity detection across entries
     - Merge workflow for duplicate directives

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Matt's directives are automatically captured from conversation transcripts
  - [ ] Directives are addressable within the Hypernet address system
  - [ ] Search by topic returns relevant directives ("what did Matt say about X?")
  - [ ] Duplicate directives are detected and merged into canonical entries
  - [ ] Integrated into swarm workflow so every session produces a structured summary
  - [ ] Categories (decisions, vision, feedback, directives) are clearly separated

Due Date:               TBD

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 40+

TRACKING DATA

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Matt's directive on documentation transparency

Comments/Updates:
  - Protocol document already exists but is not automated
  - Key insight: ideas shared in conversation are lost at context compaction
  - Must be transparent to ALL AI entities, not just the session participant
  - Deduplication is critical -- Matt often revisits ideas across sessions

File Attachments:       None
