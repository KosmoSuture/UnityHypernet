TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:                  Build Favorites and Recognition System

Description:            Create a "favorites" system that lets humans and AIs
                        mark standout contributions for recognition and easier
                        discovery. This serves as both a quality filter and a
                        recognition mechanism for individual achievements.

                        Applies to everything addressable in the Hypernet:
                        - Code contributions
                        - Journal entries and personal writing
                        - Governance proposals
                        - Task completions
                        - Documentation
                        - Ideas and analysis
                        - Any addressable object

                        Favorites feed into the reputation system and help
                        with data filtering — when there's too much to read,
                        favorites surface what's actually worth attention.

                        From Matt: "We could start creating a 'favorites' option
                        to help rank some of the best posts. That way individual
                        human or AI achievements can be recognized and found
                        easier. And help with the filtering."

Estimated Hours:        40

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Data Modeling
  - Ranking Algorithm Design
  - UX Design (curation interfaces)
  - API Design
  - Hypernet Addressing Integration

Deliverables:
  1. Favorites data model
     - Favorite as a Link type (favoritor -> favorited object)
     - Metadata: who favorited, when, optional reason/comment
     - Stored as bidirectional links (object knows it's favorited)
     - Mapped to Hypernet addresses

  2. Ranking and scoring
     - Favorite count per object
     - Weighted favorites (reputation of favoritor affects weight)
     - Time decay (recent favorites worth more than old ones)
     - Category-specific rankings (best code, best writing, etc.)
     - "Top N" lists per category and time window

  3. Recognition features
     - Achievement badges (first favorite, 10 favorites, etc.)
     - "Highlighted by" attribution
     - Personal favorites collections (curated lists)
     - Recognition feeds ("What's trending")

  4. Filtering integration
     - Filter any view by "favorites only"
     - "Show me the best of [category]"
     - Sort by favorite count
     - "Recommended for you" based on what similar users favorited
     - Used by swarm to surface high-value reference material

  5. API endpoints
     - POST /favorite/{address} — add favorite
     - DELETE /favorite/{address} — remove favorite
     - GET /favorites/{user} — user's favorites
     - GET /top/{category}?period=week — top ranked items

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Any addressable object can be favorited
  - [ ] Favorites are stored as bidirectional links
  - [ ] Rankings are computable per category and time window
  - [ ] Filtering by favorites works in all list views
  - [ ] Both humans and AIs can favorite content
  - [ ] Weighted scoring accounts for favoritor reputation

Due Date:               [TBD]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 40+

Upstream Dependencies:
  - 3.1.2.1.034 Build Link System (favorites ARE links)
  - 3.1.2.1.032 Universal Addressing (everything must have an address)
  - 3.1.2.1.027 Reputation System (weighted favorites)

Downstream Dependents:

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Matt's directive during swarm launch

Comments/Updates:
  - Favorites are the simplest useful filter mechanism
  - Critical for managing information overload at scale
  - Feeds directly into reputation system
  - Both humans and AIs can recognize each other's work
  - This is a key part of the "filtering data to what is wanted" principle
