TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA

Title:                  Build Link System and Start Linking Data

Description:            Build the link system and BEGIN ACTUALLY LINKING DATA
                        in the Hypernet. This is the practical implementation
                        of the link model — not just design, but actually
                        creating links between existing data.

                        Start in GitHub (file-based link storage for
                        transparency). When the Hypernet servers are ready,
                        the link structure migrates via APIs.

                        This task turns the Hypernet from a collection of
                        addressed objects into a connected graph. Every
                        relationship between objects should be a link.

                        From Matt: "We also need to start building the link
                        system and actually start linking data in the hypernet.
                        Initially, doing it all in GitHub for transparency."

Estimated Hours:        100

Actual Hours:           0 (Link class exists in code but not used at scale)

Skills Required:
  - Graph Database Concepts
  - Data Modeling
  - Python Development
  - Information Architecture
  - Documentation

Deliverables:
  1. Link storage implementation (GitHub-first)
     - File-based link registry format
     - Link creation API (local, file-based)
     - Link query API (find all links from/to an address)
     - Bidirectional link enforcement
     - Link type taxonomy

  2. Initial link types defined
     - depends-on / blocks (task relationships)
     - authored-by / created-by (attribution)
     - references / cited-by (documentation)
     - child-of / parent-of (hierarchy)
     - related-to (general association)
     - extends / extends-from (inheritance)
     - replaces / replaced-by (versioning)

  3. Linking pass — existing data
     - Link all tasks to their dependencies (already documented)
     - Link AI instances to their contributions
     - Link documents to their authors
     - Link governance rules to their enforcement
     - Link addresses to their specifications
     - Link code files to their documentation

  4. Link visualization
     - Graph view of linked data
     - Link type filtering
     - Traversal tools (follow link chains)
     - Statistics (most linked, orphans, etc.)

  5. Migration-ready format
     - Links stored in a format that maps to Hypernet API
     - Import/export tools
     - Integrity verification

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Link storage system is operational
  - [ ] At least 100 links created between existing data
  - [ ] Bidirectional links enforced (both sides recorded)
  - [ ] Link types cover all major relationship categories
  - [ ] Links are queryable (from/to/type)
  - [ ] Format is ready for migration to Hypernet servers
  - [ ] All existing task dependencies are linked

Due Date:               [ASAP — transforms the Hypernet from list to graph]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 100+

RELATIONSHIP LINKS

Assigned To:            [Unassigned — ENTIRE SWARM can create links]

Upstream Dependencies:
  - 3.1.2.1.032 Universal Addressing (need addresses before linking)
  - 3.1.2.1.033 Address Notation (need full notation for precise links)
  - 3.1.2.1.022 Bidirectional Link Governance (governance rules)
  - Existing: hypernet/link.py (Link class)

Downstream Dependents:
  - All graph-based features
  - 3.1.2.1.027 Reputation System (reputation stored as links)
  - 3.1.2.1.013 Transparency Dashboard (link visualization)

Related Documents:
  - hypernet/link.py (existing Link implementation)
  - hypernet/graph.py (existing Graph implementation)
  - 0.0 Metadata/HYPERNET-ADDRESSING-SYSTEM.md

Parent Task:            None (Top-level task)

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - The Link class already exists in hypernet/link.py
  - This is about USING it — actually creating links at scale
  - GitHub transparency is key for this phase
  - Great swarm task — AI workers can each link a category
  - "Link system" is as fundamental as "address system"
  - Transforms the Hypernet from a collection to a network

SWARM DECOMPOSITION HINTS

This is a great swarm parallelization task — linking can be done per category.
