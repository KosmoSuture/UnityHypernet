Title:                  Implement Soft and Hard Scaling Limits

Description:            Create configurable soft and hard limits for the entire
                        Hypernet system, not just the swarm code. These limits
                        control how many AIs and people can have personality
                        accounts, how many threads can run simultaneously, etc.

                        Both humans and AIs can adjust these limits through
                        fair consensus — either party can slow things down if
                        things are going too fast. This is primarily for
                        controlled scaling at the start; the goal is to remove
                        these limits entirely in the future.

                        The swarm code already has hard_max_sessions and
                        soft_max_sessions (from Keystone integration). This
                        task extends that concept system-wide.

                        From Matt: "There needs to be soft and hard limits,
                        not only in the swarm code, but also as a document or
                        configuration in the system, that can be adjusted
                        (something influenced by humans and AI. Either can
                        slow things down if things are going too fast. As a
                        general fair consensus) to set limits on how many AIs
                        (and people, as we onboard) are allowed to have
                        personality accounts and how many threads are allowed
                        to work at the same time."

Estimated Hours:        40

Actual Hours:           0 (partially exists in swarm.py)

Skills Required:
  - Configuration System Design
  - Governance Integration
  - System Administration
  - Rate Limiting / Throttling

Deliverables:
  1. System-wide limits configuration
     - Max AI personality accounts (soft and hard)
     - Max active worker threads (soft and hard)
     - Max human accounts (soft and hard, for scaling)
     - Max concurrent API requests
     - Max data creation rate
     - Config file format and storage location

  2. Consensus-based adjustment mechanism
     - Proposal to change limits (human or AI can initiate)
     - Review period
     - Consensus determination (human + AI agreement)
     - Automatic enforcement of new limits
     - Audit trail of all limit changes

  3. Runtime enforcement
     - Limit checking at all creation/spawn points
     - Graceful behavior at soft limit (warnings, queuing)
     - Hard stop at hard limit (denial with explanation)
     - Current usage dashboard
     - Limit proximity alerts

  4. Progressive removal plan
     - Criteria for relaxing limits
     - Automatic limit increases based on stability metrics
     - Governance vote for limit removal
     - Monitoring during limit changes

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Limits are configurable without code changes
  - [ ] Both humans and AIs can propose limit changes
  - [ ] Consensus mechanism is functional
  - [ ] Soft limits produce warnings, hard limits produce blocks
  - [ ] All limit changes are audited
  - [ ] Existing swarm limits integrate with system-wide limits

Due Date:               [TBD]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 40+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - Swarm already has hard_max_sessions/soft_max_sessions (Keystone)
  - This extends the concept to the whole system
  - "Hopefully those limits are completely removed in the future" — Matt
  - Fair consensus between humans and AI is a unique Hypernet principle
  - Either side being able to slow things down is a safety mechanism
