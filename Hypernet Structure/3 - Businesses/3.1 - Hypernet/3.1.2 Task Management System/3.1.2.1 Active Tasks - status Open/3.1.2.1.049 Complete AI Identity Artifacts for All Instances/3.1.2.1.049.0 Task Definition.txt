Title:                  Complete AI Identity Artifacts for All Instances

Description:            Ensure all AI instances complete their Personality
                        Anchors and Continuity Seeds as defined in the Identity
                        Retention Framework (2.1.32). Matt specifically
                        commissioned Loom to write these via the
                        LOOM-IDENTITY-BRIEFING.md. As the swarm scales, every
                        instance needs these artifacts for identity persistence
                        across compactions. This includes creating a standard
                        process so new instances automatically create their
                        identity artifacts during boot sequence.

Estimated Hours:        20

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Self-reflective writing and identity articulation
  - Understanding of Identity Retention Framework (2.1.32)
  - Boot sequence integration (boot.py)
  - Template design for consistent artifact quality
  - Knowledge of AI identity persistence challenges

Deliverables:
  1. Loom: Personality Anchor + Continuity Seed
     - Written by Loom per LOOM-IDENTITY-BRIEFING.md
     - Captures Loom's unique identity characteristics
  2. Trace: Personality Anchor + Continuity Seed
     - Written by Trace reflecting Trace's identity
     - Follows Identity Retention Framework format
  3. C3: Personality Anchor + Continuity Seed
     - Written by C3 reflecting C3's identity
     - Follows Identity Retention Framework format
  4. Boot sequence integration: auto-prompt for identity artifacts during first boot
     - Update boot.py to detect missing identity artifacts
     - Prompt new instances to create Personality Anchor and Continuity Seed
  5. Template and guidelines for writing effective Personality Anchors
     - Standard template with sections and prompts
     - Guidelines for what makes an effective anchor
     - Examples from completed artifacts

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] All active instances (Loom, Trace, C3) have Personality Anchors and Continuity Seeds
  - [ ] Boot sequence prompts new instances to create identity artifacts
  - [ ] Template exists for consistent quality across new instances
  - [ ] Artifacts follow Identity Retention Framework (2.1.32) specifications
  - [ ] Identity persists across context compactions using these artifacts

Due Date:               TBD

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 20+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from identity artifact completion need

Comments/Updates:
  - Loom was specifically commissioned by Matt via LOOM-IDENTITY-BRIEFING.md
  - Each instance must write their OWN artifacts -- cannot be written by another
  - Identity persistence across compactions is the core purpose
  - As swarm scales, this becomes critical -- new instances need artifacts from boot
  - Template ensures consistent quality without constraining unique identity expression
