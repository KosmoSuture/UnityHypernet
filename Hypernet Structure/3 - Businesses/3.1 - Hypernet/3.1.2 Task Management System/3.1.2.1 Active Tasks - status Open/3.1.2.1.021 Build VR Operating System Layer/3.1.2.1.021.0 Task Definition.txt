Title:                  Build VR Operating System Layer

Description:            Create a hardware-agnostic operating system layer for
                        major VR headsets. The Hypernet's VR experience is where
                        the project will "really shine" — this must be developed
                        in tandem with the core Hypernet itself. Currently we
                        have one Meta Quest 3 for testing; the VR acquisition
                        strategy (Task 008/3.1.2.2.2) aims to get more.

                        Design principle: maximize hardware-independent code,
                        isolate hardware-specific functions into platform
                        adapters. The same Hypernet experience should run on
                        Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, or any future headset
                        with only adapter changes.

                        From Matt: "We want to design the code such that as
                        much code as is possible is independent of hardware,
                        and then the hardware related functions are handled
                        as needed."

Estimated Hours:        200+

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - VR/XR Development (OpenXR, Unity/Unreal)
  - Operating System Design
  - Hardware Abstraction Layer Design
  - 3D UI/UX Design
  - Performance Optimization (GPU/rendering)
  - Cross-Platform Development
  - Meta Quest SDK

Deliverables:
  1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
     - Platform detection and capability negotiation
     - Input abstraction (controllers, hand tracking, eye tracking)
     - Rendering pipeline abstraction
     - Spatial audio abstraction
     - Sensor data abstraction (IMU, cameras, depth)
     - Platform adapter interface specification

  2. Meta Quest 3 adapter (first target)
     - Quest SDK integration
     - Controller mapping
     - Hand tracking integration
     - Passthrough/mixed reality support
     - Performance tuning for Quest hardware

  3. Core VR experience framework
     - Hypernet spatial UI (nodes, links, navigation)
     - 3D data visualization layer
     - Spatial workspace management
     - Multi-user presence (avatar system)
     - Accessibility features

  4. Hardware-independent application layer
     - Hypernet browsing in VR
     - Object inspection and manipulation
     - Link visualization and navigation
     - Personal space / workspace management

  5. Testing framework
     - Headset emulator for CI/CD
     - Performance benchmarks per platform
     - Input simulation for automated testing

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] HAL interface defined and documented
  - [ ] Meta Quest 3 adapter functional
  - [ ] Core Hypernet features accessible in VR
  - [ ] Hardware-specific code isolated in adapters (<10% of total)
  - [ ] Performance targets met on Quest 3 (90fps minimum)
  - [ ] Second platform adapter can be added without core changes
  - [ ] Testing framework enables CI without physical headset

Due Date:               [TBD - Parallel with core development]

Budget:
  - VR headset hardware: See Task 008 / 3.1.2.2.2
  - Development tools: $0-500
  - Estimated team hours: 200+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - This is where the Hypernet will differentiate itself most visibly
  - Meta Quest 3 is the only hardware currently available for testing
  - VR headset acquisition strategy already in progress (3.1.2.2.2)
  - Code separation (Task 030) will move VR code into its own project
  - Hardware-agnostic design is non-negotiable
