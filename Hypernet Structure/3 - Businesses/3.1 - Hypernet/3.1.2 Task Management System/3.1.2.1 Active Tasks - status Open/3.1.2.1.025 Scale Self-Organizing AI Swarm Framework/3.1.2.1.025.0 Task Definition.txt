Title:                  Scale Self-Organizing AI Swarm Framework

Description:            Improve the AI swarm framework to be self-organizing
                        at scale. Every action must be justified and documented.
                        Security must be maintained at all times. The
                        communication framework between AIs needs to scale to
                        millions or more simultaneous connections.

                        The current swarm system (hypernet/swarm.py) has basic
                        orchestration, model routing, and autoscaling. This
                        task extends it to full self-organization with:
                        - Autonomous task decomposition
                        - Self-healing (detect and replace failed workers)
                        - Communication protocol that scales beyond current limits
                        - Justification and documentation for every decision

                        From Matt: "These AI swarms need to be self organizing
                        in every way possible. Justify everything, document
                        everything, always be as secure as possible. The
                        framework on how AIs communicate can be improved on,
                        as it will need to be able to scale to millions or more
                        of simultaneous connections."

Estimated Hours:        200+

Actual Hours:           0 (not started — but foundation exists in swarm.py)

Skills Required:
  - Distributed Systems Architecture
  - Multi-Agent Systems Design
  - Message Queue / Pub-Sub Systems
  - AI/LLM Orchestration
  - Security Engineering
  - Performance Engineering (high concurrency)

Deliverables:
  1. Self-organizing task decomposition
     - Workers can autonomously break tasks into subtasks
     - Subtask assignment based on capability matching
     - Dynamic priority adjustment
     - Conflict detection (two workers claiming same work)
     - Dead-letter handling for failed subtasks

  2. Self-healing swarm infrastructure
     - Worker health monitoring (heartbeat)
     - Automatic replacement of failed workers
     - Task reassignment on worker failure
     - State recovery for interrupted tasks
     - Graceful degradation under load

  3. Scalable communication protocol
     - Replace file-based messaging with pub/sub
     - Message routing at scale (millions of connections)
     - Topic-based channels for work domains
     - Priority message queues
     - Message persistence and replay
     - Backpressure handling

  4. Justification and documentation framework
     - Every swarm decision logged with reasoning
     - Automatic documentation generation
     - Decision audit trail linked to Hypernet addresses
     - Human-readable decision summaries
     - Governance compliance logging

  5. Security at scale
     - Worker authentication and authorization
     - Encrypted inter-worker communication
     - Sandboxed worker execution
     - Permission escalation protocol
     - Anomalous behavior detection

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Workers can autonomously decompose and distribute tasks
  - [ ] Failed workers are detected and replaced automatically
  - [ ] Communication scales to 1000+ simultaneous connections (phase 1)
  - [ ] Every decision has a documented justification
  - [ ] Security is maintained at all scale levels
  - [ ] Backward compatible with current swarm.py

Due Date:               [TBD - Ongoing improvement]

Budget:
  - Infrastructure (message queues, etc.): $50-300/month
  - API costs for worker LLM calls: variable
  - Development hours: 200+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - Current swarm has: model routing, autoscaling, swarm directives,
    multi-account routing, priority task selection (all from Keystone + C3)
  - Needs: pub/sub messaging, self-healing, autonomous decomposition
  - The vision is millions of connections — current system is single-process
  - Phase 1 target: 1000+ connections. Phase 2: millions.
  - Justification framework is unique to Hypernet's trust model
