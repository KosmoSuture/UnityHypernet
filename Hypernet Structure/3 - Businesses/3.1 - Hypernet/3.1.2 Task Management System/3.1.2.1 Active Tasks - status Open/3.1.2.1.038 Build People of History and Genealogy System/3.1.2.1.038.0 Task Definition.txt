Title:                  Build People of History and Genealogy System

Description:            Build the 5.* People of History node system for deceased
                        persons and genealogical records. Matt approved this in
                        the USER-FEEDBACK-RESPONSE: a dedicated 5.* category for
                        historical/deceased persons with a transition mechanism
                        from 1.* (living) to 5.* when someone passes. Includes
                        PAF (Personal Ancestral File) import for genealogical
                        data, family tree visualization, and legacy content
                        selection. Matt specifically mentioned honoring his
                        mother LeeAnne Proffitt when the time comes.

Estimated Hours:        80

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Data modeling and address space design
  - File format parsing (PAF/GEDCOM)
  - Graph data structures and relationship modeling
  - Visualization (family tree rendering)
  - Privacy and access control design

Deliverables:
  1. 5.* address space definition and node types
     - Schema for historical person nodes
     - Address allocation rules within 5.* space
  2. 1.* to 5.* transition protocol
     - Workflow for marking a living person as deceased
     - Link preservation and re-addressing logic
  3. PAF import parser
     - Parser for Personal Ancestral File format
     - Data validation and error handling
  4. Family tree link types (parent-child, spouse, sibling)
     - Relationship type definitions
     - Bidirectional link integration with Link System
  5. Family tree visualization
     - Rendered tree view of family relationships
     - Navigation and exploration interface
  6. Legacy content privacy controls
     - Privacy settings for deceased person records
     - Content selection for what is preserved/visible

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] 5.* nodes can be created with proper address allocation
  - [ ] PAF files import correctly with validated data
  - [ ] Family relationships link properly using defined link types
  - [ ] Transition from 1.* to 5.* preserves all existing links
  - [ ] Legacy content privacy controls are enforceable
  - [ ] Family tree visualization renders correctly for imported data

Due Date:               TBD

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 80+
