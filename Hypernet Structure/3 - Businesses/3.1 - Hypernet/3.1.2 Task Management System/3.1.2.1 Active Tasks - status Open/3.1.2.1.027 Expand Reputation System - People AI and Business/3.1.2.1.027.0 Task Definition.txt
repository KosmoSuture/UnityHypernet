TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:                  Expand Reputation System — People, AI, and Business

Description:            Extends Task 020 (initial reputation design) into a
                        comprehensive, multi-entity reputation system covering
                        people, AIs, and businesses.

                        PEOPLE: Skills/knowledge reputation maps directly to
                        Hypernet Addresses. Social reputation is PUBLIC and
                        transparent — good or bad. This requires extreme care
                        in design due to unintended consequences.

                        AI: AI instances have reputation that tracks reliability,
                        quality of work, trustworthiness, and contribution.

                        BUSINESS: Businesses measured on traits like
                        environmental consciousness, honesty, and others
                        determined by public consensus.

                        All reputation systems are additive — new dimensions
                        can be proposed and adopted through governance.

                        From Matt: "Much of the reputation system (like for
                        skills or knowledge) can be mapped as a direct pointer
                        to the Hypernet Address that represents it."

                        "Social reputation needs to be developed in a way that
                        it can benefit mankind and help push people towards
                        the good. Reputation in their personal lives, good or
                        bad, will follow them and be public."

                        "This level of transparency of public data is necessary,
                        but there will be unintended consequences, much of
                        which the reputation system and governance in everything
                        is so important. This must be developed with care."

Estimated Hours:        120

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Algorithm Design
  - Game Theory / Anti-Gaming
  - Social Systems Design
  - Ethics / Philosophy
  - Data Science
  - Governance Design
  - Privacy Engineering

Deliverables:
  1. People reputation system
     a. Skills/knowledge reputation
        - Direct mapping to Hypernet skill addresses
        - Peer validation and endorsement
        - Work output quality tracking
        - Learning/growth trajectory
     b. Social reputation
        - Public transparency design (benefits vs. risks)
        - Positive behavior incentives
        - Negative reputation consequences and recovery
        - Privacy governance for edge cases
        - Cultural sensitivity framework
        - Unintended consequences analysis document

  2. AI reputation system
     - Task completion quality metrics
     - Reliability and uptime tracking
     - Code/output quality scoring
     - Trust tier advancement criteria
     - Instance personality consistency
     - Cross-provider comparison

  3. Business reputation system
     - Environmental consciousness metrics
     - Honesty and transparency scores
     - Customer satisfaction integration
     - Employee/contributor satisfaction
     - Community impact measurement
     - Custom trait proposals via governance

  4. Address-mapped reputation architecture
     - Reputation scores stored at dedicated HA addresses
     - Skill reputation -> skill address pointers
     - Cross-referencing between entity types
     - Aggregation across dimensions
     - Historical tracking and trends

  5. Governance for reputation dimensions
     - New dimension proposal process
     - Public vote on adoption
     - Removal/modification governance
     - Appeals process for reputation scores
     - Abuse prevention

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] People can see their skills reputation mapped to HA addresses
  - [ ] Social reputation is public and transparent
  - [ ] AI reputation tracks work quality and reliability
  - [ ] Business reputation includes environmental and honesty metrics
  - [ ] New reputation dimensions can be added via governance
  - [ ] Anti-gaming measures pass adversarial testing
  - [ ] Unintended consequences analysis is complete and reviewed
  - [ ] Recovery mechanisms exist for all reputation types

Due Date:               [TBD - After Tasks 009 and 020]

Budget:
  - Research: 40+ hours
  - Implementation: 80+ hours
  - Ethics review: External consultation recommended
