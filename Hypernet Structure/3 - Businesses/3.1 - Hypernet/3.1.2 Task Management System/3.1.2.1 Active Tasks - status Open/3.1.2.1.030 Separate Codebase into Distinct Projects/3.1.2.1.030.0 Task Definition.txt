Title:                  Separate Codebase into Distinct Projects

Description:            The current codebase has everything mixed together.
                        Separate it into at minimum three distinct projects:

                        1. Core Hypernet servers and data structure
                        2. VR and other platform code (phones, computers)
                        3. Swarm software (AI orchestration)

                        Each should be independently deployable and
                        contributable. This enables people to run their own
                        instances of each component independently.

                        From Matt: "Right now everything is mashed up together,
                        but it needs to be organized by code type... the core
                        Hypernet servers and structure, VR and other platforms,
                        including phones and computers, and the swarm software.
                        That needs to be developed separate so that if people
                        want to join in and run their own instances of it."

Estimated Hours:        40

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Software Architecture
  - Repository Management
  - CI/CD Pipeline Design
  - Package Management (Python, npm)
  - API Interface Design

Deliverables:
  1. Project separation plan
     - Dependency analysis between current components
     - Clean interface definitions between projects
     - Shared library identification
     - Repository structure (monorepo vs multi-repo decision)

  2. Core Hypernet project
     - Server code, addressing, nodes, links, store, graph
     - API layer
     - Database and storage
     - Independent build/test/deploy
     - Package: `hypernet-core`

  3. Platform/VR project
     - VR OS layer (Task 021)
     - Mobile adapters
     - Desktop adapters
     - Web client
     - Package: `hypernet-platform`

  4. Swarm project
     - Orchestrator, workers, identity
     - Task queue, model routing
     - Boot sequence, permissions
     - Package: `hypernet-swarm`

  5. Shared interface contracts
     - API schemas between projects
     - Message formats
     - Version compatibility matrix
     - Integration test suite

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Three distinct projects can build independently
  - [ ] Each project has its own tests, CI, and deployment
  - [ ] Interfaces between projects are documented
  - [ ] Someone can contribute to swarm without touching core
  - [ ] Someone can run their own instance of each component
  - [ ] No circular dependencies between projects

Due Date:               [TBD - Before external contributors onboard]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 40+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - Current structure: everything under 0/0.1 - Hypernet Core/hypernet/
  - This is blocking external contributions — too tangled
  - Each project needs its own README, setup guide, and contribution guide
  - Consider monorepo with workspaces vs separate repos
  - People running their own instances is key for decentralization
