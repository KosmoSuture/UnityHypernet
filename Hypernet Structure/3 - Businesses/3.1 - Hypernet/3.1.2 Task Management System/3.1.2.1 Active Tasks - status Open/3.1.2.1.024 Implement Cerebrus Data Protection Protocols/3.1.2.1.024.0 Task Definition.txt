TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:                  Implement Cerebrus Data Protection Protocols

Description:            Build the Cerebrus intermediary system that protects
                        user data by analyzing risk before fulfilling data
                        requests. All requests for user data pass through
                        Cerebrus, which evaluates risk factors and decides
                        whether to fulfill, escalate, or deny.

                        Risk factors include: amount of data requested, number
                        of people requesting it, authorization level, request
                        patterns, and more. Low-risk requests from authorized
                        users for single objects pass through quickly. High-risk
                        requests (bulk data, many requestors) require deeper
                        analysis and governance approval.

                        Includes implementation of the mandala/key system for
                        data compartmentalization.

                        From Matt: "All requests for user data go through an
                        intermediate that analyzes risk and then passes it on.
                        If it's a low risk from the user, who has been
                        authorized, for a single object, the intermediate may
                        decide to just get it. But if the amount of data, or
                        the amount of people that are asking for the data
                        (higher risk factors) may have to be analyzed deeper
                        and verified under governance that the data request
                        is allowed."

                        Extends existing Cerberus Node specification (0.2.3).

Estimated Hours:        150

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Security Engineering
  - Risk Analysis / Scoring Systems
  - Cryptography (key management, encryption)
  - Distributed Systems
  - Governance System Design
  - Access Control Systems
  - Privacy Engineering

Deliverables:
  1. Cerebrus intermediary service
     - Request interception layer
     - Risk scoring engine
     - Authorization verification
     - Decision engine (allow / escalate / deny)
     - Response filtering (return only authorized fields)
     - Audit logging of all decisions

  2. Risk scoring framework
     - Data volume risk factor
     - Requestor count risk factor
     - Authorization level factor
     - Request pattern analysis (anomaly detection)
     - Time-based risk factors (unusual hours, frequency)
     - Cumulative risk scoring algorithm
     - Configurable thresholds

  3. Mandala/key system
     - Data compartmentalization model
     - Key hierarchy design
     - Selective disclosure mechanism
     - Key rotation protocol
     - Emergency revocation
     - Multi-party key requirements for sensitive data

  4. Governance escalation integration
     - Automatic escalation for high-risk requests
     - Governance review queue
     - Approval/denial workflow
     - Audit trail for governance decisions
     - Time-limited approvals

  5. Cerebrus monitoring and alerting
     - Request rate monitoring
     - Risk score trending
     - Anomaly alerting
     - Dashboard for security team
     - Incident response triggers

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] All data requests route through Cerebrus
  - [ ] Low-risk authorized requests are fast (<100ms overhead)
  - [ ] High-risk requests trigger governance escalation
  - [ ] Mandala/key system compartmentalizes data
  - [ ] Risk scoring is configurable and transparent
  - [ ] Full audit trail for every data access decision
  - [ ] Cannot be bypassed — Cerebrus is the only data path
  - [ ] Integration with existing Cerberus Node spec (0.2.3)

Due Date:               [TBD - After Task 009 and Task 018]

Budget:
  - Security infrastructure: $100-500/month
  - External security audit: $5,000-15,000
  - Development hours: 150+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - Cerebrus is named after the three-headed guardian — protecting data
  - The mandala/key system is a unique Hypernet concept for privacy
  - Performance is critical: low-risk must be near-zero latency
  - "Protect user data in any way that can be imagined" — Matt
  - This needs to be planned in depth before implementation
