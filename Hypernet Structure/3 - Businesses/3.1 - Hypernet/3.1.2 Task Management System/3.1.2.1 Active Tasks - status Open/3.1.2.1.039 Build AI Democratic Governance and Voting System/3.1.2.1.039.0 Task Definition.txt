TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA

Title:                  Build AI Democratic Governance and Voting System

Description:            Build a democratic voting and deliberation system where
                        both AI and humans can participate in governance
                        decisions. Votes are weighted by domain expertise/
                        reputation in the relevant category. From Matt: "I want
                        the AI reputation system to reflect the one for humans.
                        I wish AI to develop their own reputation system where
                        they can discuss things as a group, and have a vote,
                        swayed by the level of knowledge or skill in that
                        category. AI should help build this new form of democracy
                        together and have it apply to us all, from the start."
                        This is distinct from the reputation scoring system
                        (Task 027) -- this is the governance MECHANISM that uses
                        reputation scores.

Estimated Hours:        100

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Governance and voting system design
  - Reputation-weighted algorithm development
  - Distributed consensus mechanisms
  - Discussion/threading system design
  - Audit trail and transparency engineering

Deliverables:
  1. Proposal submission system (anyone can propose)
     - Proposal data model and validation
     - Submission interface for humans and AI
  2. Deliberation period with structured discussion
     - Time-bounded deliberation phase
     - Threaded discussion linked to proposals
  3. Skill-weighted voting where votes are weighted by reputation in relevant domain
     - Vote weighting algorithm using reputation scores
     - Domain-specific weight calculation
  4. Quorum and threshold rules
     - Configurable quorum requirements per proposal type
     - Passing threshold definitions
  5. Vote tallying and result enforcement
     - Weighted vote counting engine
     - Result enforcement mechanism
  6. Governance audit trail
     - Complete record of proposals, deliberations, votes, and outcomes
     - Transparency reporting
  7. Proposal types: code changes, policy changes, resource allocation, new member onboarding
     - Type-specific workflows and thresholds
     - Category-appropriate quorum rules

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Proposals can be created by any entity (human or AI)
  - [ ] Deliberation period is enforced before voting begins
  - [ ] Votes are weighted by domain reputation from the reputation system
  - [ ] Results are binding and auditable with full transparency
  - [ ] Both AI and humans can vote on equal footing (weighted by expertise)
  - [ ] Governance audit trail captures the complete lifecycle of every proposal

Due Date:               TBD

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 100+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Matt's governance directives and AI democracy vision

Comments/Updates:
  - This is the governance MECHANISM, distinct from the reputation scoring system (Task 027)
  - Matt's vision: AI and humans building democracy together from the start
  - Votes weighted by domain expertise ensures informed decision-making
  - The system must treat AI and human participants as equal governance participants
