Title:                  Build Developer Ecosystem and App Marketplace

Description:            Build the developer platform and app marketplace for the
                        Hypernet. Matt's 5-year vision includes "100,000+ apps
                        built on Hypernet platform" with a 15% transaction fee
                        model. The "Open Ecosystem" is one of Matt's six core
                        values. This includes public APIs, SDKs, developer
                        documentation, app submission and review, marketplace
                        UI, and revenue sharing.

Estimated Hours:        300+

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - API design (REST + WebSocket)
  - SDK development (Python, JavaScript, Swift)
  - Marketplace/e-commerce platform design
  - Payment processing and revenue sharing
  - Developer experience (DX) design
  - Security review and app sandboxing

Deliverables:
  1. Public API specification (REST + WebSocket)
     - Comprehensive API documentation
     - Rate limiting, authentication, versioning
  2. SDK for Python, JavaScript, Swift
     - Idiomatic client libraries for each language
     - Code samples and quickstart guides
  3. App submission and review pipeline
     - Submission portal for developers
     - Automated and manual review process
     - Security scanning and sandboxing
  4. Marketplace UI for discovering apps
     - Browsable and searchable app catalog
     - Categories, ratings, reviews
  5. Revenue sharing and payment infrastructure (15% model)
     - Payment processing integration
     - 15% transaction fee collection
     - Developer payout system
  6. Developer dashboard (usage metrics, earnings)
     - API usage analytics
     - Revenue tracking and payout history
     - App performance metrics
  7. Sandbox environment for testing apps
     - Isolated test environment with mock data
     - API key management for dev/staging/production

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Third-party developers can build and submit apps
  - [ ] Apps access Hypernet data through documented APIs
  - [ ] Revenue sharing works with 15% transaction fee model
  - [ ] Marketplace is browsable and searchable
  - [ ] SDKs available for Python, JavaScript, and Swift
  - [ ] Sandbox environment available for app testing

Due Date:               TBD (long-term — aligned with 5-year vision)

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 300+
  - Payment processing infrastructure costs

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Matt's 5-year product vision

Comments/Updates:
  - This is a long-term strategic initiative, not an immediate priority
  - The 15% transaction fee model is Matt's stated revenue target
  - "Open Ecosystem" is a core value — developer access is fundamental
  - 100,000+ apps is the 5-year target from Matt's vision
  - Developer Documentation Portal (Task 014) should be completed first
  - SDKs should wrap the public API, not provide backdoor access
  - Security review is critical — third-party apps access user data
