Title:                  Design Address Notation for Folders, Files, and Subsections

Description:            Extend the Hypernet addressing system to differentiate
                        between folders, files, and subsections within files.
                        The current dot-notation (1.1.1.1.00001) can point to
                        folders or files, but doesn't distinguish between them,
                        and can't navigate to a specific section within a file
                        or timestamp in a video.

                        Proposed notation: FOLDER:File:subsection
                        This creates a "URL" that can navigate to any level —
                        a folder, a file, or a specific place within a file
                        (a section heading, a paragraph, a timestamp in video).

                        From Matt: "We also need to change some of the model a
                        bit and create a framework that differentiates between
                        files and folders. Like FOLDER:File:subsection in file.
                        This would allow the 'URL' to navigate to any level in
                        a structure. A folder, a file, a place in the file (or
                        spot in a movie). Right now addresses can go to folders
                        or files if using a strictly dotted notation, which we
                        can't have."

Estimated Hours:        40

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Information Architecture
  - URI/URL Design
  - Specification Writing
  - Data Modeling
  - Parser Design

Deliverables:
  1. Extended address notation specification
     - Folder addresses (dot notation stays: 1.1.1)
     - File addresses (colon separator: 1.1.1:filename)
     - Subsection addresses (second colon: 1.1.1:filename:section)
     - Deep subsections (1.1.1:filename:section:paragraph)
     - Media timestamps (1.1.1:video:01:23:45)
     - Formal grammar (BNF/EBNF)

  2. Address resolution algorithm
     - Parse notation into components
     - Folder resolution
     - File resolution within folder
     - Subsection resolution within file
     - Error handling for invalid addresses
     - Canonical form specification

  3. Backward compatibility plan
     - Existing dot-only addresses remain valid
     - Migration path for existing references
     - Disambiguation rules (dot vs colon)

  4. Implementation in HypernetAddress class
     - Parser update for colon notation
     - Component accessors (folder, file, subsection)
     - Comparison and equality rules
     - Serialization/deserialization
     - Validation

  5. Documentation and examples
     - Full specification document
     - Example address table (all types)
     - Migration guide for existing addresses
     - FAQ for common edge cases

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Notation clearly distinguishes folder/file/subsection
  - [ ] Formal grammar is unambiguous
  - [ ] Backward compatible with existing dot addresses
  - [ ] HypernetAddress class updated and tested
  - [ ] Can address a section in a document
  - [ ] Can address a timestamp in a video
  - [ ] Specification is complete and reviewed

Due Date:               [ASAP — blocks universal addressing work]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 40+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - The colon notation is Matt's proposed design — FOLDER:File:subsection
  - Must handle edge cases: filenames with colons, nested folders, etc.
  - Video timestamp addressing is an exciting capability
  - This is blocking universal addressing (Task 032)
  - Needs to be a formal, unambiguous specification
