Title:                  Build Mobile App (iOS First)

Description:            Build a mobile app for the Hypernet, starting with iOS.
                        Listed in Matt's short-term next steps as a Q1 2026
                        deliverable alongside the private beta. The app provides
                        mobile access to the Hypernet for viewing, searching,
                        and interacting with data. Should support photo capture
                        directly into Hypernet nodes, push notifications for
                        swarm status, and basic data browsing.

Estimated Hours:        200+

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - iOS development (Swift/SwiftUI)
  - Mobile API design and integration
  - Mobile authentication patterns
  - Offline-first data architecture
  - Push notification infrastructure (APNs)
  - Camera and media capture APIs

Deliverables:
  1. iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI)
     - Native iOS application targeting iOS 16+
     - SwiftUI-based interface following Apple HIG
  2. Authentication and account linking
     - Secure login flow linking to Hypernet account
     - Token management and session handling
  3. Data browsing by address
     - Navigate Hypernet address space on mobile
     - View nodes, metadata, and relationships
  4. Photo/media capture to Hypernet nodes
     - Camera integration for direct capture into Hypernet
     - Automatic address assignment and metadata extraction
  5. Search across Hypernet data
     - Full-text and metadata search from mobile
     - Search results with navigation to nodes
  6. Push notifications (swarm status, messages)
     - APNs integration for real-time updates
     - Notification categories for different event types
  7. Offline capability with sync
     - Local data cache for offline browsing
     - Queue changes offline, sync when connected
     - Conflict resolution for offline edits

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] App runs on iOS 16+
  - [ ] Users can browse their Hypernet data by address
  - [ ] Photos captured go into proper address space with metadata
  - [ ] Search works across Hypernet data from mobile
  - [ ] Offline changes sync correctly when connection restored
  - [ ] Push notifications delivered for swarm status updates

Due Date:               Q1 2026 (aligned with private beta)

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 200+
  - Apple Developer Program: $99/year

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Matt's Q1 2026 product roadmap

Comments/Updates:
  - iOS first because of Matt's primary user base and Apple ecosystem strength
  - API layer from the website task (004) is a prerequisite for mobile
  - Offline-first is critical — mobile users expect to work without connectivity
  - Photo capture into Hypernet is a key differentiator for mobile
  - Android version will follow as a separate task once iOS is proven
  - Consider React Native or Flutter only if cross-platform becomes urgent
