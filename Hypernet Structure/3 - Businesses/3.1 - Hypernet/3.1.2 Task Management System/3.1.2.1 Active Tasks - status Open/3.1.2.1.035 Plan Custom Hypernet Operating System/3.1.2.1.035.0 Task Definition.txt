Title:                  Plan Custom Hypernet Operating System

Description:            Plan a custom operating system built from the ground up
                        for the Hypernet. The OS would be highly specialized,
                        with a minimal instruction set, cryptographically signed
                        image, and the Hypernet code embedded as part of the OS.

                        The image is immutable — cannot be changed or modified.
                        All core parts are always locked and cannot be opened
                        without verified cryptographic keys. Encrypted code
                        runs without being decrypted to disk. Every line of
                        code from boot is completely and securely maintained.

                        This is a LONG-TERM goal. This task is PLANNING ONLY.

                        From Matt: "We also need to start planning the final
                        operating system, which I would prefer is custom built,
                        from the ground up. The Hypernet is going to be very
                        specialized and only need a very small set of
                        instructions. This image would be cryptographically
                        signed, and the Hypernet code embedded as a part of it.
                        It is a set image, that cannot be changed or modified
                        in any way. All core parts of the system are always
                        locked, and cannot be opened without the verified
                        cryptographic key, which runs the encrypted code
                        without decrypting."

                        "We want to encrypt and secure every bit of the system,
                        to the best we can, while maintaining complete security
                        at every level. That way eventually, every single line
                        of code from boot is completely and securely maintained
                        by the system."

Estimated Hours:        80 (planning only)

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - This is the ULTIMATE long-term vision for the Hypernet
  - Start with planning and research only
  - Look at seL4 (formally verified microkernel) as reference
  - Every line of code from boot — fully verified and secured
  - Immutable OS image is a powerful security model
  - Could run on custom hardware or commodity servers
