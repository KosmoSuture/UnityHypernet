TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:                  Enforce Universal Addressing — Everything Gets an Address

Description:            EVERYTHING in the Hypernet MUST have a Hypernet Address.
                        No exceptions. Currently, much of the Hypernet data
                        lacks addresses. This task audits the entire structure,
                        assigns addresses to everything that doesn't have one,
                        and establishes enforcement so nothing can be created
                        without an address going forward.

                        This is foundational — linking (Task 034), reputation
                        (Task 027), governance, and migration all depend on
                        everything being addressable.

                        Initial implementation is in GitHub (for transparency).
                        When the Hypernet servers are ready, the addressing
                        structure migrates into the Hypernet via APIs.

                        From Matt: "Everything has to have an address in the
                        Hypernet. There is much in the Hypernet that doesn't
                        have a number. EVERYTHING, without exceptions, has to
                        have an address."

                        "Initially, doing it all in GitHub for transparency,
                        but then when we have the Hypernet fully developed
                        enough that we can migrate all of the data into the
                        Hypernet through the APIs, we'll at least have a
                        similar structure that things can migrate into."

Estimated Hours:        80

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Information Architecture
  - Data Modeling
  - Hypernet Addressing System (0.0 spec)
  - Systematic Auditing
  - Documentation

Deliverables:
  1. Complete address audit
     - Inventory every item in the Hypernet structure
     - Identify everything without an address
     - Categorize by address space (0.x, 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, etc.)
     - Gap analysis document

  2. Address assignment for all unaddressed items
     - Documents, files, folders, sections
     - Governance rules, procedures
     - People, AI instances, businesses
     - Tasks, projects, discussions
     - Media, links, metadata

  3. Address assignment protocol
     - How new addresses are allocated
     - Who can assign addresses
     - Address format validation rules
     - Collision prevention
     - Address reservation system

  4. Enforcement mechanism
     - Nothing created without an address
     - Validation at creation time
     - Orphan detection (things that lost addresses)
     - Regular audit schedule

  5. Migration preparation
     - GitHub structure -> Hypernet API mapping
     - Address preservation during migration
     - Link maintenance during migration
     - Rollback plan

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Every item in the Hypernet has an address
  - [ ] Audit document shows 100% coverage
  - [ ] New items cannot be created without an address
  - [ ] Address format follows HYPERNET-ADDRESSING-SYSTEM.md
  - [ ] Migration path to Hypernet servers is documented
  - [ ] Address assignment protocol is clear and enforceable

Due Date:               [ASAP — blocking many downstream tasks]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 80+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - This is CRITICAL priority — Matt explicitly said "no exceptions"
  - The audit is a great swarm task — decomposable across workers
  - Each top-level category (0, 1, 2, 3) can be audited in parallel
  - Existing addressing spec is at 0.0 Metadata
  - GitHub transparency first, Hypernet migration later

File Attachments:       None

SWARM DECOMPOSITION HINTS
================================================================================
This is ideal for swarm parallelization — each category can be audited independently.
