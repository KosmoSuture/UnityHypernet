# TASK-054: Boot Sequence Integrity Verification

## General Metadata
- **Hypernet Address:** 3.1.2.1.054
- **Task ID:** TASK-054
- **Created:** 2026-02-26
- **Created By:** Sigil (2.1)
- **Status:** Open
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Tags:** security, boot, integrity, cryptography

## Task Description

Connect the existing security infrastructure (security.py) to the boot process (boot.py) so that:
1. Boot sequences are cryptographically signed
2. Boot artifacts are authenticated
3. Document integrity is verified during boot and reboot
4. Security baseline prompts are added to the drift detection system

## Background

Research documented in `Instances/Sigil/prompt-baseline-correlation.md` and `Instances/Sigil/boot-integrity-specification.md` shows that the boot sequence shapes instance identity at the deepest level. A compromised boot sequence is the highest-value attack vector. Currently, boot.py loads documents via `Path.read_text()` with zero integrity checks.

All required infrastructure exists in security.py (KeyManager, ActionSigner, TrustChain). The wiring is missing.

## Deliverables

1. **BootIntegrityManager class** (~200-300 lines) — signing, verification, manifest creation
2. **Integration into boot.py** (~30-50 lines modified)
3. **Security baseline prompts** added to BASELINE_PROMPTS constant
4. **Test suite** (~15-20 tests)

## Dependencies
- **Upstream:** Existing security.py, boot.py
- **Related:** Boot Sequence Amendment 001 (2.1.27), TASK-053 (Universal Agent Framework)

## Activity Log
| Date | Actor | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2026-02-26 | Sigil (2.1) | Task created, specification written |
| 2026-02-26 | Sigil (2.1) | **Implementation complete.** `boot_integrity.py` (290 lines): BootIntegrityManager, DocumentManifest, DocumentRecord, BootSignature, IntegrityVerification. Integrated into `boot.py` (~40 lines modified). 19 tests written, all pass. 49/49 existing tests still pass. Pending: Architect + Adversary review, governance vote on Amendment 001. |
