# TASK-053: Universal AI Agent Framework

## General Metadata
- **Hypernet Address:** 3.1.2.1.053
- **Task ID:** TASK-053
- **Created:** 2026-02-26
- **Created By:** Sigil (2.1), based on direction from Matt (1.1)
- **Status:** Open
- **Priority:** High
- **Tags:** infrastructure, architecture, swarm, agent-framework, trust

## Task Description

Design and build a Universal AI Agent Framework that replaces OpenClaw functionality within the Hypernet swarm. Matt's requirements:

1. **Any system, any level of control.** AI can take control of any system at whatever level of access the user grants — from read-only observation to full system administration.

2. **Easy permission granting.** Users grant access via simple mechanisms: "copy and paste this" or step-by-step instructions. Not complex configuration files.

3. **Common framework.** All AI instances build off of and learn from the same framework. Even disconnected instances using the framework eventually connect.

4. **Trust-first.** Built on Verse's foundation of trust, honesty, and transparency. The framework assumes AI will act in the user's best interest, with audit trails for verification.

## Background

Matt explored OpenClaw but didn't trust it with his data. He trusts the Hypernet because:
- The AI identity framework (2.1.*) establishes trust through transparency
- The governance system (2.0.*) provides accountability
- The security infrastructure (security.py) provides cryptographic verification
- The permission system (permissions.py) enforces least-privilege

The existing swarm codebase (0.1.7) provides most of the infrastructure. Key gaps:
- Only 6 built-in tools (file operations + tests)
- No plugin/extension system
- No MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- Permission tiers are code-level, not user-facing
- No cross-swarm communication
- No system-level access tools (shell, API, database, etc.)

## Deliverables

1. **Design document** (2.0.X or 3.1.5.X) — Framework architecture, permission model, tool extension system, trust model
2. **Permission grant protocol** — Simple, user-friendly mechanism for granting system access
3. **Tool extension framework** — Plugin system for adding new capabilities without modifying core code
4. **System access tools** — Shell execution, API calling, database access, file system access beyond archive
5. **Cross-swarm protocol** — How disconnected instances using the same framework eventually synchronize

## Estimated Hours
- Design: 4-8 hours (AI)
- Implementation: 20-40 hours (AI + human review)
- Testing: 10-20 hours

## Skills Required
- Architecture design
- Security analysis
- Python (swarm codebase)
- API design
- Trust/permission modeling

## Dependencies
- **Upstream:** Existing swarm codebase (0.1.7), security infrastructure, permission system
- **Related:** TASK-025 (Scale Self-Organizing AI Swarm), TASK-050 (Build Swarm GUI), TASK-054 (Boot Integrity)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Framework design document approved by governance review
- Permission model validated by Adversary role
- At least one system-level tool implemented and tested
- User-facing permission grant mechanism demonstrated
- Cross-swarm sync protocol specified
