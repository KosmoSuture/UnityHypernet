TASK-SPECIFIC METADATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:                  Implement Bidirectional Link Governance

Description:            Links in the Hypernet must exist on BOTH sides of a
                        connection. This is fundamental to preventing broken
                        links and enabling governance over data relationships.

                        When an address changes or an object moves, all linked
                        objects can be discovered and updated. This also enables
                        permission-based governance: if someone links to data
                        that the owner decides to delete, governance determines
                        whether the linking party has the right to object or
                        maintain their own copy.

                        From Matt: "Part of the purpose of links being on both
                        sides, is that when we make changes to the Hypernet
                        addressing system, or something moves, you can see
                        everything that is linked to it, and you are able to
                        update the links of everything that links with them.
                        This prevents links from being broken. This also allows
                        permissions on links and governance."

                        "If someone links to data that the owner decides to
                        delete, there can be governance to decide if whoever
                        is linking them has a right to object, or possibly
                        maintain their own copy."

Estimated Hours:        100

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Graph Database Design
  - Distributed Systems
  - Governance System Design
  - API Design
  - Conflict Resolution Algorithms
  - Legal/Policy Framework Understanding

Deliverables:
  1. Bidirectional link data model
     - Forward link structure (A -> B)
     - Reverse link registry (B <- A)
     - Link metadata (created_by, created_at, link_type, permissions)
     - Automatic reverse-link creation on link creation
     - Automatic reverse-link cleanup on link deletion

  2. Link update propagation system
     - Address change detection
     - Cascade update protocol
     - Notification to all linked parties
     - Batch update for bulk address changes
     - Failure handling and retry logic

  3. Link permission framework
     - Link creation permissions (who can link to what)
     - Link visibility permissions (who can see links)
     - Link deletion governance rules
     - Owner vs. linker rights specification
     - Permission inheritance through link chains

  4. Deletion governance protocol
     - Owner deletion request workflow
     - Linker objection mechanism
     - Copy-right determination (can linker keep a copy?)
     - Governance vote trigger conditions
     - Grace period and notification system
     - Dispute resolution integration (see 0.3.4)

  5. Link integrity monitoring
     - Orphan link detection
     - Broken link scanning
     - Link health dashboard
     - Automated repair suggestions

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] All links are bidirectional by default
  - [ ] Address changes propagate to all linked objects
  - [ ] Link permissions are enforced at creation and access
  - [ ] Deletion governance workflow is functional
  - [ ] No orphan links can exist in a healthy system
  - [ ] Link operations are atomic (both sides update or neither)
  - [ ] Performance acceptable at scale (millions of links)

Due Date:               [TBD - After Task 009, parallel with Task 034]

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours
  - Estimated: 100+ hours

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-17] Task created from Matt's strategic vision briefing

Comments/Updates:
  - Links are as fundamental as addresses in the Hypernet
  - Governance on links is critical — deletion affects all linked parties
  - Must be designed to scale to billions of links
  - Atomic bidirectional operations are technically challenging but required
  - "Links will be as highly utilized and governed as possible" — Matt
