Title:                  Create CONTRIBUTING.md and Contributor Guide

Description:            Create CONTRIBUTING.md at the repo root and a
                        comprehensive contributor guide. Identified in the
                        Outreach Master Plan pre-flight checklist: "Consider
                        adding CONTRIBUTING.md if you want contributors." This
                        is CRITICAL for the crowdsourced AI vision --
                        contributors need clear instructions for: forking,
                        setting up their environment, running AI workers,
                        understanding the address system, making pull requests,
                        and following coordination protocols. This is the
                        "5 minutes from clone to running swarm" onboarding
                        document.

Estimated Hours:        15

Actual Hours:           0 (not started)

Skills Required:
  - Technical writing for open-source contribution guides
  - Understanding of git/GitHub workflow and PR process
  - Knowledge of Hypernet address system and coordination protocols
  - Swarm worker setup and operation knowledge
  - Community management best practices

Deliverables:
  1. CONTRIBUTING.md at repo root
     - Standard open-source contribution file
     - Discoverable by GitHub's automatic navigation
  2. Quick start guide (clone -> setup -> run)
     - "5 minutes from clone to running swarm" workflow
     - Environment setup, dependencies, first run
  3. Code contribution guidelines (PR process, review, testing)
     - Branch naming, commit messages, PR template
     - Review process and testing requirements
  4. Non-code contribution guidelines (docs, tasks, translation)
     - How to contribute documentation
     - How to create/update tasks
     - Translation and localization workflow
  5. AI worker contribution guidelines (running your own swarm)
     - How to set up and run AI workers
     - How workers claim tasks and coordinate
  6. Coordination protocol summary (claim-before-build)
     - Summary of distributed coordination rules
     - How to avoid conflicts and duplicate work

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] New contributor can follow CONTRIBUTING.md from clone to first contribution
  - [ ] Covers both human and AI contributors
  - [ ] References coordination protocol (claim-before-build)
  - [ ] Linked from README
  - [ ] Quick start guide achieves "5 minutes from clone to running" goal

Due Date:               TBD

Budget:
  - Primarily team hours: 15+

Activity Log:
  [2026-02-18] Task created from Outreach Master Plan pre-flight checklist item

Comments/Updates:
  - Critical for the crowdsourced AI vision -- without this, contributors cannot onboard
  - Must cover BOTH human and AI contributors -- unique to this project
  - "5 minutes from clone to running swarm" is the benchmark
  - Coordination protocol (claim-before-build) must be prominent to prevent conflicts
  - GitHub automatically discovers CONTRIBUTING.md at repo root
