Communication Framework:
Upstream Communication: "I'm blocked because I need X from the team working on Y"
Downstream Communication: "I've completed this, notifying all dependent tasks"
Lateral Communication: "I need help with [aspect], looking for someone with [skill]"

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (THIS WEEK)
For you personally, Matt:
Set up the digital infrastructure (Task 001) - even if basic
Create GitHub organization
Set up Google Workspace or equivalent
Choose project management tool
Create communication channels (Discord/Slack)
Input these 20 tasks into that system (Task 002 partially)
Create basic task tracking
Assign preliminary priorities
Survey your 80 person-hours of team (Task 003)
What skills do they have?
What interests them?
What's their availability?
Identify 2-3 people to tackle the highest priority tasks
Website MVP (Task 004)
Social media setup (Task 007)
Technical architecture doc (Task 009)

AI OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY
To maximize AI assistance for velocity:
Code Generation:
AI generates boilerplate for all systems
Humans review, refine, integrate
Focus human time on architecture decisions, not implementation
Documentation:
AI drafts all documentation from technical specs
Humans edit for accuracy and clarity
Maintain single source of truth, AI propagates updates
Content Creation:
AI generates first drafts of marketing copy, blog posts, social content
Humans refine voice, fact-check, approve
AI handles variations and repurposing
Task Management:
AI suggests task breakdowns from high-level goals
AI identifies dependencies automatically
AI recommends assignments based on skills/availability
Humans approve and adjust
Video Production:
Use AI video tools (Runway, Pika, Kling) as mentioned
AI generates visual assets
Humans direct narrative and messaging
