### Template 1: Developer Program Application Follow-up

**Subject:** Developer Hardware Request - Hypernet Universal VR Platform

**Body:**
```
Dear [Manufacturer] Developer Relations Team,

I'm reaching out regarding developer hardware access for Hypernet, an open-source project building universal VR compatibility across all major headsets.

ABOUT HYPERNET:
Hypernet is a cross-platform VR framework that enables developers to build once and deploy to all VR platforms - including [MANUFACTURER HEADSET]. We're committed to supporting the entire VR ecosystem without exclusivity or platform favoritism.

WHY THIS BENEFITS [MANUFACTURER]:
• Expands your developer ecosystem by lowering platform barriers
• Increases content availability for your users
• Demonstrates commitment to open standards and developer choice
• No exclusivity required - we support all major VR platforms equally

WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING:
• Developer hardware (loan or donation) for integration and testing
• Access to SDK documentation (if not already public)
• Optional: Technical liaison for integration questions

WHAT YOU GET:
• Native Hypernet support for [HEADSET NAME]
• Recognition as a supporter of open VR development
• Larger developer pool targeting your platform
• Input on universal VR compatibility standards

PROJECT STATUS:
• Active open-source development
• [X] contributors and growing community

### Template 2: Business Development Outreach

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - Growing VR Ecosystem Through Universal Compatibility

**Body:**
```
Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to explore a partnership opportunity between [MANUFACTURER] and Hypernet that could significantly expand your developer ecosystem.

THE CHALLENGE:
VR platform fragmentation forces developers to choose which headsets to support, limiting content availability across all platforms. This hurts manufacturers, developers, and users alike.

THE SOLUTION:
Hypernet is building an open-source, universal VR compatibility layer that allows developers to build once and deploy everywhere - including [MANUFACTURER HEADSET]. This isn't about picking winners; it's about growing the entire VR market.

WHY [MANUFACTURER] SHOULD CARE:
1. EXPAND DEVELOPER REACH: Developers currently limited by resources can now support your platform
2. MORE CONTENT: Larger library of applications attracts more users to your hardware
3. MAINTAIN DIFFERENTIATION: You still compete on hardware quality, features, and ecosystem - we just make software compatibility easier
4. ENTERPRISE APPEAL: B2B customers demand cross-platform support
5. FUTURE-PROOFING: Open standards reduce fragmentation as VR matures

WHAT MAKES HYPERNET DIFFERENT:
• 100% open-source - complete transparency
• Platform-agnostic - we support everyone equally
• Developer-first - built by developers, for developers
• No vendor lock-in - extensible architecture
• Not a competitor - we don't make hardware or sell content

HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT:
• MINIMAL ASK: Developer hardware for integration testing
• OPTIONAL: Technical liaison for SDK questions
• OPTIONAL: Co-marketing opportunities

This is a low-effort, high-impact opportunity to position [MANUFACTURER] as a leader in open VR development.

I'd welcome a brief conversation to explore how Hypernet aligns with your developer ecosystem strategy.

Are you available for a 15-minute call next week?

Best regards,

P.S. - Attached is our full partnership proposal outlining the benefits and technical approach in detail.

### Template 3: LinkedIn Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about [MANUFACTURER] developer programs

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed your work on [SPECIFIC PROJECT/TEAM] at [MANUFACTURER] - really impressive!

I'm working on an open-source project called Hypernet that's building universal VR compatibility across all major headsets (Quest, Vision Pro, Index, Vive, etc.). The goal is to make it easier for developers to support multiple platforms, which should expand the content library available for each headset.

We're currently reaching out to VR manufacturers to:
1. Acquire developer hardware for integration testing
2. Establish partnerships with companies committed to open VR ecosystems

Would you be the right person to discuss developer hardware access, or could you point me to someone on your team who handles developer relations or partnership inquiries?

Happy to share more details about the project and how it could benefit [MANUFACTURER]'s developer ecosystem.

Thanks!

### Template 4: Follow-up Email (Non-Responders)

**Subject:** Following up - Hypernet Developer Hardware Request

**Body:**
```
Hi [Team/Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [DATE] regarding developer hardware access for the Hypernet project.

QUICK RECAP:
• Hypernet = open-source universal VR compatibility framework
• We're integrating support for all major VR platforms, including [MANUFACTURER]
• Requesting developer hardware (loan/donation) for testing and integration
• This expands your developer ecosystem at minimal cost to you

PROGRESS UPDATE:
Since my last email, we've:
• [Achievement 1 - e.g., "Integrated initial OpenXR support"]
• [Achievement 2 - e.g., "Onboarded 15 developers to beta program"]
• [Achievement 3 - e.g., "Received positive response from [other manufacturer if applicable]"]

I understand you're busy, and I don't want to be a pest - but I wanted to ensure this request didn't get lost. If developer hardware access isn't possible, I'd appreciate knowing so we can explore alternative approaches.

If there's a better contact for this type of request, please let me know and I'll redirect my inquiry.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

---

## Contingency Plans

### If Response Rate is Low (<30%):
1. Revisit messaging - test different value propositions
2. Leverage community - have beta users request support
3. Social proof - public development to build credibility
4. Alternative channels - developer conferences, meetups
5. Build first, ask later - create demo integration with emulator

### If Hardware Budget is Limited:
1. Prioritize 2-3 most popular headsets
2. Community hardware loans from developers
3. Emulator/simulator integration where available
4. Phased rollout - one platform at a time

### If Manufacturers Request Exclusivity:
1. Politely decline - conflicts with mission
2. Offer "launch partner" status (first integration, not exclusive)
3. Emphasize ecosystem growth benefits
4. Find alternative manufacturer in same category

### If Legal/IP Concerns Arise:
1. Consult IP attorney
2. Use only public SDKs and documentation
3. Clean-room implementation if necessary
4. Open-source licensing clarity (MIT/Apache)
