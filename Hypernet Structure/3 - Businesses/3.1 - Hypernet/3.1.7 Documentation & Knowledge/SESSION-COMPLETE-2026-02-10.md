git push
```

### When Ready for PAF Import:
- Provide the PAF file
- Confirm which family member's genealogy it contains
- Confirm any privacy preferences for imported data

---

## 💡 Highlights

### "Explain to Aliens" Philosophy Achieved
The 0.0.0.0-START-HERE.md file truly starts at the absolute beginning. An alien civilization (or any human) can begin reading from line 1 and progressively understand:
- What numbers are
- What information is
- How communication works
- How the entire Hypernet system functions

The tree structure can now be navigated OR read as a linear progression.

### People of History - Dignified & Comprehensive
The 5.* structure honors those who came before while providing practical genealogical functionality. When your mother passes (may it be many years from now), there's a ready and honored place for her legacy. The PAF import system is ready for thousands of records.

### Everything a Person Stores - Truly Everything
The 1.0.0 structure captures not just what you requested (email, photos, videos, passwords, medical, financial) but literally everything: hobbies, recipes, pet records, vehicle maintenance, genealogy, entertainment tracking, travel history, and much more. If a person might want to store it, Hypernet can handle it.

### Family Relationships - Accurate & Respectful
All relationships are now correct. Your mother is honored. Your father has minimal documentation per your request. Your wife and children are properly represented.
