I  need to expand out the 3.1.3.4.0 section a bit before I know exactly where to put this, but I want to create monthly and overall totals for total work put in by everyone.  It will be tracked by monthly, yearly, and overall hours.  We'll break this all out into the 3.1.3.4.0 section in the future as we start seeing more hours that need to be tracked.  This is a placeholder.
