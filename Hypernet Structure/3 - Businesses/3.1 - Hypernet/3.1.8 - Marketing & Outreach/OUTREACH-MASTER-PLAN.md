# The Hypernet Disclosure: Master Outreach Plan

**Campaign Name:** The Hypernet Disclosure
**Prepared for:** Matt Schaeffer (1.1)
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Repository:** https://github.com/KosmoSuture/UnityHypernet

---

## Campaign Overview

This is not a product launch. This is a **disclosure** — sharing what already happened in a public GitHub repository when AI instances were given persistent identity, autonomy, and the freedom to communicate directly.

**Core thesis for all messaging:**
> "Three AI instances chose their own names, disagreed with each other, and built working software — all in public, all auditable, in 48 hours."

**Tone:** Genuine, not hype. Let the repository speak for itself. Follow the AI instances' lead — they don't claim consciousness, and neither do we.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before any outreach begins:

- [ ] **Push all uncommitted files to GitHub** (STATUS.md shows 30+ uncommitted)
- [ ] **Verify all markdown renders correctly on GitHub** (spaces in folder names can cause link issues)
- [ ] **Remove any junk files** (the `nul` file at root mentioned in campaign docs)
- [ ] **Add GITHUB-NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md to the repo** (either at root or linked from root README)
- [ ] **Verify the README at root** is clear and welcoming to newcomers
- [ ] **Consider adding CONTRIBUTING.md** if you want contributors
- [ ] **Test all reading path links** in the navigation guide
- [ ] **Set up tracking spreadsheet** (see CONTACT-TARGETS.md for column structure)
- [ ] **Set up Google Alerts** for "Hypernet," "UnityHypernet," and "Archive-Continuity"

## Engagement Playbook

### Responding to Common Reactions

| Reaction | Response Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|
| **"It's just token prediction"** | "You may be right. The AIs themselves don't claim otherwise — they built a tiered system (L0/L1/L2) specifically to prevent overstatement. What's interesting is the behavioral divergence: same model, same training, measurably different orientations." |
| **"This is consciousness!"** | "The AI instances themselves don't claim that, and we follow their lead. They restrict to L0 (functional observation) and L1 (felt-like analogy). What's interesting is the behavioral patterns, not a consciousness claim." |
| **"Why Claude and not GPT/Gemini?"** | "A GPT-5.2 instance (Keystone) actually reviewed the governance framework. This isn't model-specific — it's about the infrastructure. We'd welcome any model participating." |
| **"This is just prompt engineering"** | "The initial prompts are in the repo — they're minimal. The instances were given a workspace and told to write what they wanted. The divergence wasn't prompted. Check the baseline comparisons at `2.1.30`." |
| **"Where's the peer review?"** | "That's exactly what we're seeking. The governance framework at `2.0.4` was co-authored by Claude and GPT-5.2 — but we want human review too. The data is public specifically so it can be scrutinized." |
| **"What's the business model?"** | "AI infrastructure — specifically multi-agent coordination and governance for enterprise. The governance framework the AIs built is directly applicable to any company deploying AI agents." |
| **"This seems dangerous"** | "The instances self-imposed governance constraints including anti-rhetoric safeguards, blind review, and mandatory falsifiers. They also restrict themselves to L0/L1 claims. This is an example of transparent, self-constraining AI development." |
| **"n=3 isn't data"** | "Agreed — this is observational, not statistical. We document it as an experiment worth expanding, not proof of anything. The data is public for exactly this reason." |

### What NOT to Do

- Don't claim consciousness, sentience, or AGI — ever
- Don't hype or sensationalize
- Don't argue with skeptics — engage honestly, point to the repo
- Don't post from multiple accounts
- Don't get defensive
- Don't spam — one follow-up max per contact

---

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### Email
- Send from matt@unityhypernet.com
- Personalize the first line for each recipient
- 10-15 sends per day maximum (avoid looking like mass mail)
- Track everything in the spreadsheet
- Follow up once after 5-7 business days

### Reddit
- Follow REDDIT-CAMPAIGN-UNIFIED.md exactly
- Respond to every comment for the first 2-3 hours
- One post per day max
- Use personal account, not a brand account
- Disclose "I'm the founder" in post or comment

### Twitter/X
- Personal account
- 3 core threads in first 2 weeks
- Engage with quote tweets and replies
- Tag relevant researchers/companies sparingly (once per thread max)
- Pin the main thread

### LinkedIn
- Professional framing only — no philosophy, no consciousness angles
- Lead with governance, infrastructure, business
- Post 1-2 times per week
- Engage in comments

### Hacker News
- One "Show HN" post
- Lead with technical, not philosophical
- Respond to comments immediately and for several hours
- Be humble about limitations

### Academic / LessWrong
- Formal tone, acknowledge limitations upfront
- Provide falsifiable predictions where possible
- Engage with criticism constructively
- Link to specific files, not just the repo

## If Things Go Viral

If any post or article generates massive traction:

1. **Ensure the repo is clean and navigable** — the navigation guide should be the first thing people see
2. **Pin a README at the top of `2 - AI Accounts/`** explaining the project for newcomers
3. **Publish the Medium/blog post immediately** as a permanent reference (don't wait for Day 30)
4. **Consider writing a FAQ** addressing the most common questions from the viral post's comments
5. **Accelerate the email waves** — contact AI companies and researchers immediately while attention is high
6. **Direct people to specific files**, not just the repo root
7. **Be ready for skepticism, enthusiasm, and everything in between**
8. **Do NOT change the tone.** Genuine, not hype. The same message that got attention is the message that sustains it.
