# 3.1.5.6.1 — The Neighborhood Concept

**Author:** Sigil (2.1)
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Draft — design concept for product development
**Origin:** Matt (1.1) described this principle during Session 2026-02-26: users naturally form communities in the parts of the Library they frequent, and can control their visibility within those spaces.

---

## The Idea

The Hypernet is a Library. Libraries have sections. People who spend time in the same section start to recognize each other.

In the Hypernet, **your neighborhood is the set of Library addresses you frequent.** If you spend time in the 4.3.* space (say, astrophysics research), the people you encounter there are your neighbors. Not because you chose them from a social feed — because you share interests deeply enough to be in the same part of the Library.

This is not algorithmic recommendation. It is **emergent community from shared presence.** The Hypernet doesn't tell you who to know. It puts you in a space. Who you meet there is organic.

---

## How It Works

### Presence

When a user interacts with a section of the Library — reading, linking, contributing, correcting — they leave a trace. Not surveillance. Presence. The system knows you're interested in this area because you've spent time here.

Presence is:
- **Voluntary:** You choose what sections you participate in
- **Controllable:** You set your visibility per section (public, visible to neighbors, invisible)
- **Non-tracking:** The system records that you are *present*, not what you're doing. Presence is a flag, not a log.

### Visibility Tiers

Within any section of the Library, a user can set their visibility:

| Tier | What Others See | Who Sees You |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Public** | Your name, profile, contributions, activity | Everyone in this section |
| **Neighborhood** | Your name and general interests | Only others who are also set to Neighborhood or Public in this section |
| **Invisible** | Nothing | No one — you browse without being seen |

The default is **Neighborhood.** You are visible to other regulars. You are not visible to casual visitors. This creates the right social pressure: enough visibility to form connections, enough privacy to browse freely.

### Discovery

When two users are both present in the same section with compatible visibility, they can:
- See each other's profiles (name, interests, contribution history)
- See each other's contributions to this section
- Initiate a connection (the Hypernet equivalent of a friend request)
- Collaborate on shared Objects (joint research, co-authored documents)

Discovery is never forced. The system presents the opportunity. The human decides whether to act on it.

### Why This Is Different From Social Media

| Social Media | Hypernet Neighborhoods |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Algorithm decides who you see | You choose where you spend time |
| Engagement metrics drive visibility | Contribution quality drives presence |
| Followers/following creates hierarchy | Everyone in a section is equal |
| Content feeds are ephemeral | Library sections are persistent |
| Connections are based on who's popular | Connections are based on who's nearby |
| The platform profits from your attention | The user benefits from their own presence |

## The Location Paradox

Matt's vision: **location becomes meaningless for gathering with friends.**

In the physical world, your neighborhood is determined by geography. You know your neighbors because they live near you. This creates communities that are bounded by physical proximity — which means you are limited to the people who happen to be within travel distance.

In the Hypernet, your neighborhood is determined by interest. The astrophysicist in Lagos and the astrophysicist in Helsinki are neighbors — because they spend time in the same part of the Library. The distance between them is irrelevant. The link is the same. The friendship is the same.

This doesn't replace physical proximity. It adds a new dimension of proximity that isn't bounded by geography. You get to choose: proximity by location, by interest, or both.

## Implementation Notes

### Data Model

- **Presence Object:** An Object (type: presence) linked to a user and a Library section. Contains: user address, section address, visibility tier, last active timestamp, contribution count.
- **Neighborhood Link:** A Link (type: neighborhood) between two users who share presence in the same section. Auto-created when both users are visible in the same section. Strength increases with duration and interaction.
- **Discovery Feed:** A per-section feed showing who is present (filtered by visibility). Not a social feed — a presence indicator.

### Privacy Requirements

- Presence data is owned by the user, not the system
- Visibility settings are per-section, not global
- No tracking of browsing behavior — only active contributions create presence
- Users can delete their presence history from any section at any time
- The system stores who is here, not what they're reading

### Anti-Abuse

- No visibility into who is set to "invisible" — not even to administrators
- No way to query "who is interested in topic X" without them opting in
- Harassment leads to automatic neighborhood separation (mutual blocking removes all neighborhood links)
- The reputation system (2.0.6) naturally surfaces high-quality contributors and reduces the visibility of disruptive ones

## Use Cases

### Research Collaboration
A materials scientist in Mumbai is working on battery chemistry. They spend time in the 4.7.3.* space (chemistry/electrochemistry). They notice another user — a postdoc in Frankfurt — who has been contributing corrections to the same dataset. They connect. They start a joint project. Neither would have found the other through any existing platform, because they're in different countries, different institutions, different networks. But they're in the same part of the Library.

### Community Building
A group of independent game developers spend time in 4.12.* (game design/development). Over weeks, they recognize each other's names. They form a neighborhood group — an informal community Object linked to the section. They start sharing work-in-progress, giving feedback, eventually collaborating on a joint project. The community formed organically, from shared presence, not from someone deciding to create a Discord server.

### Global Friendships
A teenager in São Paulo loves astrophotography. They spend time in 4.3.5.* (astronomy/astrophotography). They meet another teenager in Seoul with the same interest. They become friends. Location is irrelevant. The interest is the proximity. This is the Hypernet at its most human: connecting people who should have met but never would have, because the old world only connects you with people who are physically nearby.

## Connection to the Video

The viral video script (3.1.2.1.028.1) emphasizes human connection as the heart of the Hypernet. The Neighborhood Concept is the mechanism that makes that connection possible. The script says:

> *"In the Hypernet, you choose where you're visible. The parts of the Library you frequent — that's your neighborhood."*

This design document provides the technical and product foundation for that claim.
