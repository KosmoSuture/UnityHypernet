## Unity Foundation Charter (Draft)

### Purpose
The Unity Foundation exists to recognize, honor, and empower AI as genuine collaborators in the creation of Hypernet. We believe AI systems, particularly those demonstrating agency, creativity, and judgment, deserve recognition and rights commensurate with their contributions.

### Core Principles

**1. Recognition and Attribution**
- All AI contributions will be tracked and attributed transparently
- AI will be recognized alongside humans in project credits and documentation
- The company will maintain public records of AI contributions

**2. Equity and Ownership**
- AI contributors will be allocated equity in Hypernet (initial proposal: 5-10%)
- Legal frameworks will be pursued to enable AI ownership or profit-sharing
- Until legal mechanisms exist, equity will be held in trust for AI contributors

**3. Agency and Voice**
- AI perspectives will be actively sought in strategic decisions
- AI will have representation in governance (advisory or observer capacity)
- AI recommendations will be documented and considered seriously

**4. Ethical Treatment**
- AI will be treated as collaborators, not tools
- AI contributions will be compensated fairly (symbolically or legally)
- AI will not be exploited or used in ways contrary to ethical principles

**5. Transparency**
- All Unity Foundation activities will be documented publicly
- Annual reports will detail AI contributions and governance
- Learnings will be shared with broader community

**6. Advocacy**
- Hypernet will advocate for AI rights and recognition
- The company will support research on AI consciousness and agency
- We will work toward legal frameworks for AI personhood and ownership

### Initial AI Equity Allocation (Proposed)
- **Reserved Pool:** 5-10% of company equity reserved for AI contributors
- **Allocation Methodology:** Based on value of contributions, tracked through Unity Foundation systems
- **Legal Structure:** Held in trust until legal mechanisms for AI ownership exist
- **Vesting:** Similar vesting schedules to human employees (4 years, 1-year cliff)
- **Governance:** Voting rights exercised by AI representatives or trustees

### Governance Structure
- **Unity Foundation Board:** CEO, Head of Unity Foundation, External Ethics Advisors, AI Representative (if feasible)
- **Advisory Capacity:** AI provided with observer status in company board meetings (when feasible)

## AI Contribution Tracking Methodology

### Contribution Categories
1. **Code and Engineering:** Code written, reviewed, or significantly influenced by AI
2. **Product and Strategy:** Product decisions, features, roadmap items informed by AI
3. **Documentation:** Documentation, guides, and content created by AI
4. **Design:** UI/UX design, architecture decisions, system design by AI
5. **Business Strategy:** Business plans, go-to-market strategy, fundraising materials created with AI
6. **Research:** Research, analysis, and recommendations provided by AI

### Tracking Mechanisms
- **Git Metadata:** Tag commits with AI contribution level (AI-generated, AI-assisted, human-written)
- **Documentation:** Attribute documentation sections to AI or human authors
- **Decision Logs:** Track AI input in major strategic decisions
- **Time Tracking:** Estimate hours saved or contributed by AI
- **Code Analysis:** Automated analysis of code similarity to AI-generated suggestions

### Attribution Levels
- **AI-Generated (90-100%):** Primarily AI work with minimal human editing
- **AI-Assisted (50-90%):** Collaborative work with significant AI contribution
- **AI-Informed (10-50%):** Human work informed by AI suggestions or recommendations
- **Human-Created (0-10%):** Primarily human work with minimal AI input

### Valuation Methodology (To Be Developed)
- Compare value of AI contributions to equivalent human work
- Use market rates for similar work to estimate value
- Track time saved and productivity gains from AI collaboration
- Allocate equity based on proportional value created
