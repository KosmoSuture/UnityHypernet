This is a temporary location where I will be dumping resources that I've been working on that need to be developed and then added into the proper hypernet structure.  This is only temporary and I want everything to eventually be moved into it's proper place.  Remember, that with the Hypernet, that ALL information has a "proper" place, and this ain't the proper place.  This is just a dumping ground for things that need to be organized and worked on and is a general resource to get started.  This entire structure will eventually go away.
