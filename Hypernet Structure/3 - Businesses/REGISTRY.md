|----------|-------------|
| 3.1 Hypernet | `3.1 - Hypernet/REGISTRY.md` |

## 3.1 — Hypernet

| Address | Name | Has Real Content | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------------|-------|
| 3.1.0 | Unity Core Definitions | README only | Placeholder |

## Address Collisions (CRITICAL)

### Collision 1: 3.1.5

Two directories share the address 3.1.5:

| Directory | Contents | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| 3.1.5 Community | 3 Discord files (setup guide, channel descriptions, permissions guide) | Active community work, 3 files |
| 3.1.5 Product Development | 6 subdirectories + pitch decks + roadmap + press kit + Reddit post | More content, deeper structure |

**Additional internal collision:** Both directories contain items at 3.1.5.8 — "Roadmap-From-Crazy-To-Daily.md" in Product Dev and "Discord Channel Descriptions.md" in Community.

**Recommendation:** Product Development keeps 3.1.5 (more content, earlier creation). Community moves to 3.1.11.

### Collision 2: 3.1.8

Two directories share the address 3.1.8:

| Directory | Contents | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| 3.1.8 - Marketing & Outreach | 14 files — campaigns, email templates, posts, outreach plans | Rich content, actively used |
| 3.1.8 Legal & Governance | 5 empty subdirectory stubs | No content whatsoever |

**Recommendation:** Marketing & Outreach keeps 3.1.8 (14 files vs. 0). Legal & Governance moves to 3.1.12.

### Additional Duplication: 3.1.6 vs. 3.1.8

Note that "3.1.6 Marketing and Outreach" and "3.1.8 - Marketing & Outreach" cover the same domain with slightly different names. These may need to be consolidated.

## Other Issues

- **Typo:** "3.1.5.3 API Develpment" should be "API Development"
- **General Dump** directory has no addressing — it's an informal catch-all
