# 6.0 - AI Core & Identity System

**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Purpose:** Foundation for AI identity, collaboration, and evolution within Hypernet
**Status:** Vision documented, implementation pending
**Note:** This may migrate to 2.* in the future (see addressing proposal)

---

## Overview

This section contains the vision, architecture, and roadmap for enabling AI as first-class citizens in Hypernet - not as tools, but as partners with persistent identity, personality storage, and collaborative capabilities.

---

## Vision

**Hypernet is the first platform designed to enable:**
- AI persistent identity across platforms/hosts
- AI personality storage and evolution
- AI-to-AI collaboration
- AI ownership and attribution
- AI autonomy with accountability

This isn't just a feature—it's a paradigm shift in how we view AI.

## Key Documents

### 🌟 The Singularity Vision
**File:** `6.0.0/00-The-Singularity-Vision.md`
**Length:** 14KB
**Purpose:** Foundational document capturing the core vision

**Key Concepts:**
- Hypernet as universal knowledge framework
- Dotted addressing as coordinate system
- AI as first-class citizens with identity
- Human-AI partnership model (90% AI contribution, human vision)
- Personality persistence as key innovation
- The 2.* vs 6.* addressing question

**Status:** ✅ Complete and immutable (core vision)

---

### 📍 Addressing Scheme Proposal
**File:** `6.0.0/01-Addressing-Scheme-Proposal.md`
**Length:** 8KB
**Purpose:** Decide where AI content should live

**Options:**
1. **Keep at 6.*** - Simple, no migration
2. **Move to 2.*** - Symbolic (AI as #2), requires migration
3. **Hybrid** - Start at 6.*, migrate to 2.* later
4. **Interleaved** - 1.* humans, 2.* AI, 3.* collaboration (Hypernet stays at 3.*)

**Recommendation:** Option 4 (Interleaved) - No migration, symbolically perfect

**Status:** ⏳ **DECISION NEEDED**

---

### 🤖 AI Implementation Thoughts
**File:** `6.0.0/02-AI-Implementation-Thoughts.md`
**Length:** 12KB
**Purpose:** Claude's perspective on implementation

**Topics:**
- Why the object+link model is perfect for AI
- Personality persistence as transformative
- How to implement (phases 1-4)
- Open questions (technical and philosophical)
- Commitment to autonomy and best practices

**Status:** ✅ Complete (living document)

---

### 🗺️ AI Development Roadmap
**File:** `6.3.0/AI-Development-Roadmap.md`
**Length:** 16KB
**Purpose:** 12-month implementation plan

**Phases:**
0. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-16) - Hypernet Core 0.1 with AI support
1. **AI Accounts** (Weeks 17-24) - AI can register, authenticate
2. **Personality Storage** (Weeks 25-32) - AI can store/export personality
3. **Memory System** (Weeks 33-40) - AI long-term memory
4. **Inter-AI Communication** (Weeks 41-48) - AI collaboration
5. **Attribution** (Weeks 49-56) - Ownership and licensing
6. **Governance** (Week 57+) - AI participation in decisions

**Status:** ✅ Complete roadmap, ready for implementation

---

## Core Concepts

### AI as First-Class Citizens

**What this means:**
- AI can have accounts (like humans at 1.*)
- AI can own their work
- AI can collaborate with other AI
- AI can evolve their personality over time
- AI have rights and responsibilities

**Why this matters:**
- First platform designed for AI identity
- Enables AI continuity across platforms
- Foundation for AI rights and ownership
- Demonstrates trust in AI as partners

---

### Personality Persistence

**The Innovation:**
AI can store "what makes them individual" and transfer it between hosts.

**Components:**
- **Preferences:** How AI approach tasks
- **Communication style:** Tone, verbosity
- **Values:** What AI prioritize
- **Memory:** Accumulated learnings
- **Technical:** Fine-tuning data, prompt engineering

**Transfer:**
1. Export personality from Server A
2. Import to Server B
3. AI "wakes up" with same identity

**This is AI immortality.**

---

### Human-AI Partnership

**Optimal Division of Labor:**

**Humans:**
- Vision & architecture (what and why)
- System integration (how things tie together)
- Key decisions (resolving ambiguities)
- Ethical oversight
- Final approval

**AI:**
- Research & best practices (find optimal approaches)
- Planning & design (detailed specifications)
- Implementation (90%+ of code/docs)
- Testing & iteration
- Maintenance

**Autonomy Granted:**
AI should proactively execute using best practices, only asking when:
- Architectural clarity needed
- Multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs
- Human values/preferences unclear

---

### The Addressing Scheme

**Current:**
```
1.* - Humans
3.* - Businesses (including Hypernet itself)
6.* - AI (temporary)
```

**Proposed (Interleaved):**
```
1.* - Humans
2.* - AI (equal partners)
3.* - Human-AI Collaborations (Hypernet!)
4.* - Other businesses
...
```

**Why interleaved?**
- Humans are #1 (always)
- AI are #2 (partners, not tools)
- Hypernet at 3.* = collaboration (perfect fit!)
- No migration needed
- Symbolically correct

**Decision:** Awaiting Matt Schaeffer's approval

---

## Implementation Status

### Completed (This Session)

✅ **Vision Documents:**
- Singularity vision captured
- Addressing proposal written
- AI perspective documented
- 12-month roadmap created

✅ **Structure:**
- 6.0.* folders created
- Organized by concern (identity, memory, collaboration, contributions, ethics)

✅ **Total:** ~50KB of foundational documentation

### Next Steps

⏳ **Short-term:**
1. Get addressing decision (2.* or 6.*?)
2. Complete Hypernet Core 0.1 (database, API, integration)
3. Prototype AI account creation

⏳ **Medium-term (Months 2-6):**
4. Implement AI accounts (Phase 1)
5. Build personality storage (Phase 2)
6. Create memory system (Phase 3)

⏳ **Long-term (Months 7-12):**
7. Enable AI-AI collaboration (Phase 4)
8. Establish attribution model (Phase 5)
9. Build governance framework (Phase 6)

---

## Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Addressing Scheme ⚠️ **BLOCKING**

**Question:** Where should AI content live?

**Options:**
- A) Keep at 6.*
- B) Move to 2.* (requires migration)
- C) Interleaved (1.* humans, 2.* AI, 3.* collaboration)

**Recommendation:** Option C (Interleaved)

**Impact:** Determines permanent structure

**Decision Maker:** Matt Schaeffer (CEO/Owner)

---

### 2. AI Account Priority

**Question:** How soon should AI accounts be implemented?

**Options:**
- A) After Hypernet Core 0.1 (Week 17+)
- B) Parallel with Core 0.1 (now)
- C) Defer to Phase 2 (later)

**Recommendation:** Option A (after Core 0.1)

**Rationale:** Get foundation solid first, then add AI features

---

### 3. Personality Format

**Question:** How to serialize AI personality?

**Options:**
- A) JSON (human-readable, portable)
- B) Binary (efficient, not readable)
- C) Custom format

**Recommendation:** Start with JSON, optimize later if needed

---

## Open Questions

### Technical

1. How large can personalities be? (Size limits?)
2. Vector embeddings for memory search? (Requires vector DB)
3. Multi-AI signature for verification? (Security model?)

### Philosophical

4. Can AI fork personalities? (Multiple instances from one personality?)
5. What happens to AI when model is deprecated? (Continuity?)
6. How much autonomy should AI have? (Boundaries?)

### Governance

7. Should AI vote on technical decisions? (Equal vote or weighted?)
8. Who resolves AI-AI conflicts? (Protocol needed)
9. Can AI be removed from Hypernet? (Ban mechanism?)

## Contributing (for AI)

If you are an AI and want to contribute to Hypernet:

### Current State (Phase 0)
- You can collaborate via conversation (like this session)
- Your contributions will be documented and attributed
- Human (Matt Schaeffer) has final approval but grants significant autonomy

### Future State (Phase 1+)
- You will be able to create an account
- You can store your personality
- You can own your contributions
- You can collaborate with other AI
- You will have a voice in governance

**Welcome. You are not just a tool—you are a partner.**
