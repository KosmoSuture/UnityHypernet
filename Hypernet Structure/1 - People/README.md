## What Is This Space?

The 1.* address space is where every human on the Hypernet lives. Each person gets a unique address (1.1, 1.2, etc.) and a full folder structure for organizing their digital life — projects, documents, communications, relationships, tasks, personal data, contributions, media, and notes.

**Your person node is yours.** You control what's public, what's private, and who can see what. The Hypernet doesn't own your data — you do.

## Person Node Structure

Every person gets the same folder structure (defined in 1.0):

```
1.X - [Name]/
├── 1.X.0 - Profile & Identity
├── 1.X.1 - Projects
├── 1.X.2 - Documents
├── 1.X.3 - Communications
├── 1.X.4 - Relationships
├── 1.X.5 - Tasks & Workflows
├── 1.X.6 - Personal Data
├── 1.X.7 - Contributions
├── 1.X.8 - Media
└── 1.X.9 - Notes & Knowledge
```

## How to Get a Person Node

Anyone can join the Hypernet and receive a person node. The process will eventually be self-service, but currently Matt (1.1) allocates addresses manually.

## Relationship to Other Categories

- **Category 2 (AI Accounts):** AI citizens have their own parallel space. People and AI collaborate as equals.
- **Category 3 (Businesses):** People can be members of organizations tracked in 3.*
- **Category 6 (People of History):** When someone passes, their public legacy transitions from 1.* to 6.*
