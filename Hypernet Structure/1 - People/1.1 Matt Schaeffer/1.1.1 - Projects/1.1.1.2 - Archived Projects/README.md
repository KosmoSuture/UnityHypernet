**Owner:** Matt Schaeffer (1.1)
**Category:** Projects & Work - Archived
**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026

## Purpose

This folder stores projects that were paused, cancelled, or abandoned. These projects didn't reach completion but contain valuable information, lessons, and context that may be useful in the future.

---

## What Goes Here

### Project Types
- **Paused Projects:** On hold indefinitely, may resume someday
- **Cancelled Projects:** Deliberately stopped before completion
- **Abandoned Projects:** Gradually stopped without formal closure
- **Failed Ventures:** Projects that didn't achieve their goals
- **Pivoted Projects:** Projects that evolved into something else
- **Deprioritized Work:** Projects postponed for more important work
- **Experimental Projects:** Tests or proofs-of-concept that concluded
- **Sunset Projects:** Projects that served their purpose and were retired

### Project Documentation

Each archived project should include:
- **Archive Reason:** Why the project was stopped or paused
- **Final State:** Where things were left off
- **Key Learnings:** What was discovered or learned
- **Obstacles Encountered:** What prevented completion
- **Salvageable Assets:** Code, designs, or ideas worth keeping
- **Decision Documentation:** Why cancellation/pause was decided
- **Historical Context:** Background and original motivation
- **Potential for Revival:** Conditions under which it might resume

## Privacy Considerations

### Default Privacy Level
- **Private:** Most archived projects should remain private
- **Confidential:** Failed business ventures may contain sensitive data
- **Learning Material:** Some failures can be shared for learning
- **Historical Record:** Valuable for personal reflection

### Data Sensitivity
- May contain failed business ideas worth protecting
- Could include reasons for failure that are sensitive
- Might document interpersonal issues or conflicts
- May contain partial client work that wasn't delivered
- Could include competitive intelligence no longer relevant

### Archival Integrity
- Preserve as-is without editing history
- Document honest reasons for stopping
- Keep confidential internal discussions
- Maintain for learning and reference

## Integration Sources

### Potential Data Sources
- **Project Management Tools:**
  - Cancelled Asana/Trello boards
  - Closed-without-completion Jira projects
  - Abandoned Notion databases

- **Version Control:**
  - GitHub repositories (incomplete branches)
  - Abandoned forks
  - Experimental branches

- **Communication Archives:**
  - Slack channels for cancelled projects
  - Email threads about project cancellation
  - Final status updates

- **Planning Documents:**
  - Draft business plans
  - Incomplete specifications
  - Abandoned roadmaps

- **Financial Records:**
  - Investment that wasn't recovered
  - Sunk costs documentation
  - Write-off records

### Automation Opportunities
- Auto-archive projects with no activity for 6+ months
- Flag projects for review when stale
- Summarize lessons from archived projects
- Extract reusable components
- Pattern detection across failed projects

---

## Lifecycle Management

### Moving to Archived
Projects move here from **1.1.1.0 - Active Projects** when:
- Formally cancelled or paused
- No activity for extended period (6+ months)
- Resources reallocated to other priorities
- Obstacles prevent continuation
- Goals no longer relevant
- Team disbanded or unavailable

### Potential for Revival
Some archived projects may be:
- **Revived:** Moved back to Active if circumstances change
- **Referenced:** Used as inspiration for new projects
- **Mined:** Components extracted for other projects
- **Studied:** Analyzed to avoid repeating mistakes

### Permanent Deletion
Consider deleting archived projects only when:
- Zero potential for future value
- Storage space is critical
- Legal/compliance requires removal
- After 10+ years with no reference

---

## Best Practices

1. **Document Why:** Always record reason for archiving
2. **Be Honest:** Write truthful reasons for failure/pause
3. **Extract Lessons:** What did you learn?
4. **Save Assets:** Keep reusable code, designs, research
5. **No Shame:** Archived projects are learning opportunities
6. **Regular Review:** Annually review archived projects
7. **Consider Revival:** Some ideas just need better timing
8. **Preserve Context:** Future you will appreciate details

## Value of Archived Projects

### Learning Value
- **Failure Analysis:** Understand what went wrong
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring problems
- **Risk Assessment:** Learn what risks to avoid
- **Better Planning:** Inform future project planning
- **Resource Estimation:** Learn about time/cost realities

### Asset Recovery
- **Reusable Code:** Extract useful functions or modules
- **Design Elements:** Salvage good design concepts
- **Research Data:** Market research remains valuable
- **Network Contacts:** Relationships built during project
- **Documentation:** Specs or docs useful elsewhere

### Personal Growth
- **Humility:** Remind yourself that failure is normal
- **Persistence:** See how many attempts lead to success
- **Evolution:** Track how your skills have improved
- **Judgment:** Understand how your priorities shifted
- **Wisdom:** Accumulated knowledge from experience
