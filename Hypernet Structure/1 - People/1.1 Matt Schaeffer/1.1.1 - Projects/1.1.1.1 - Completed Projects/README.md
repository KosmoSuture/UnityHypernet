## Privacy Considerations

### Default Privacy Level
- **Private:** Personal projects remain private
- **Professional:** Work projects may be shared in portfolio
- **Portfolio:** Selected projects made public for showcasing
- **Confidential:** Client work maintains NDA protections

### Data Sensitivity
- Remove sensitive client data before archiving
- Redact proprietary information for portfolio use
- Maintain confidentiality agreements even after completion
- Consider what can be shared publicly vs internally

### Long-term Storage
- Completed projects are historical records
- May be referenced for future similar projects
- Can be used for resume and portfolio building
- Should be preserved for professional history
