## Task Management Methodology

### Getting Things Done (GTD)
1. **Capture:** Collect all tasks in one place
2. **Clarify:** What is it? Is it actionable?
3. **Organize:** Put tasks in appropriate lists
4. **Reflect:** Review tasks regularly
5. **Engage:** Do the tasks

### Eisenhower Matrix
**Quadrant 1 - Urgent & Important:** Do first
**Quadrant 2 - Important, Not Urgent:** Schedule
**Quadrant 3 - Urgent, Not Important:** Delegate
**Quadrant 4 - Not Urgent or Important:** Eliminate

### Time Blocking
- Assign specific time blocks for tasks
- Group similar tasks together
- Protect deep work time
- Build in buffer time

### Eat the Frog
- Do hardest/most important task first
- Don't procrastinate on big tasks
- Build momentum with early win

**Medium (This Month):**

**Low (Someday/Maybe):**

### Priority Assessment Criteria

## Task Tracking Best Practices

1. **Clear and Actionable:** Use verb to start (Call, Write, Review, etc.)
2. **Specific:** "Call Dr. Smith" not "Doctor appointment"
3. **One Action:** Break down large tasks into subtasks
4. **Add Context:** When/where/what's needed
5. **Set Deadlines:** Even if flexible, pick a date
6. **Estimate Time:** Helps with scheduling
7. **Review Daily:** Look at today's tasks each morning
8. **Review Weekly:** Big picture review of all tasks
9. **Update Status:** Keep status current
10. **Celebrate Completion:** Mark done and reflect on progress
