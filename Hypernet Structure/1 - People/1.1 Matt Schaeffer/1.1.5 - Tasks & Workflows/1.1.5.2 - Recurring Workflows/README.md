## Owner/Responsible Party
[Who owns this process]

## Prerequisites
- [What's needed before starting]

## Step-by-Step Process
1. Step one with specific details
2. Step two with specific details
3. [Continue...]

## Tools & Resources
- Tool 1: [Link or location]
- Template: [Link or location]

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Check 1
- [ ] Check 2

## Common Issues & Solutions
**Issue:** [Problem that might occur]
**Solution:** [How to resolve]

## Time Required
Estimated: [X] minutes/hours

## Last Updated
