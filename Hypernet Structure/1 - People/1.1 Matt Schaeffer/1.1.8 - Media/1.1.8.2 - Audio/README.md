# Product Idea - AI Task Prioritizer

**Hypernet Address:** 1.1.8.2.00234
**Date Recorded:** February 8, 2026 at 11:30 PM
**Duration:** 3:45
**Location:** Home, late night

## Context
Late-night idea for new feature in HyperTask app. Couldn't sleep, so recorded voice memo to capture thoughts while fresh.

- Energy level indicators
- Context awareness (location, calendar)
- Suggest optimal task order

## Transcription
"Okay, so I'm thinking about adding an AI feature to HyperTask that learns when you're most productive for certain types of tasks. Like, I notice I do my best creative work in the morning, but admin tasks are better in the afternoon when my energy is lower. The AI could analyze patterns and suggest which tasks to do when..."
