## Privacy Considerations

### Default Privacy Level
- **Private:** Only accessible by owner by default
- **Professional:** Work projects may be shared with team members
- **Confidential:** Some projects require additional security

### Data Sensitivity
- Work projects may contain proprietary information
- Personal projects may contain private interests and goals
- Projects under NDA require extra protection
- Consider marking each project with appropriate privacy level

### Sharing Controls
- Projects can be selectively shared with collaborators
- Access can be granted per-project basis
- Track who has access to what projects
- Revoke access when projects complete
