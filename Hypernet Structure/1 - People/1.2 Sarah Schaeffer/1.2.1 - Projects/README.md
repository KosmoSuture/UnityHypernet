## Privacy Considerations

### Default Privacy Level
- **Private:** Most projects are private by default
- **Professional:** Work projects may be shared with team
- **Confidential:** Some projects require extra security

### Data Sensitivity
- Work projects may contain proprietary information
- Personal projects contain private interests and goals
- Client projects should follow confidentiality rules
- Each project should have its own privacy level

### Sharing Controls
- Projects can be shared selectively with collaborators
- Access granted per-project basis
- Revoke access when projects complete
- Track who has access to what
