# 1.2.1.2 - Archived Projects

**Hypernet Address:** `1.2.1.2`
**Owner:** Sarah Schaeffer (1.2)
**Category:** Projects & Work - Archived
**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026

## Purpose

This folder stores projects that were discontinued, cancelled, paused indefinitely, or are no longer relevant. These projects did not reach completion but may contain valuable information.

---

## What Goes Here

### Project Types
- **Cancelled Projects:** Projects that were stopped before completion
- **Paused Projects:** Projects on indefinite hold
- **Discontinued Ventures:** Business or personal ventures that ended
- **Failed Experiments:** Ideas that didn't work out as planned
- **Superseded Projects:** Projects replaced by newer approaches
- **Inactive Projects:** No activity for extended period (6+ months)

### Project Documentation

Each archived project should include:
- **Archive Reason:** Why the project was discontinued
- **Archive Date:** When it was moved to archived status
- **Project State:** What was completed before archiving
- **Lessons Learned:** What was learned from the experience
- **Salvageable Assets:** Useful materials for future projects
- **Historical Context:** Why it seemed like a good idea at the time

## Privacy Considerations

### Default Privacy Level
- **Private:** Most archived projects are private
- **Learning:** Some may be referenced for lessons learned
- **Historical:** Kept for personal historical record

### Data Sensitivity
- May contain ideas that could be revisited
- Failed business ideas should remain confidential
- Personal projects may contain private interests
- Some archived work may still be under NDA

### Long-term Value
- Archived projects teach valuable lessons
- May inspire future similar projects
- Document what doesn't work as well as what does
- Preserve institutional knowledge

---

## Integration Sources

### Potential Data Sources
- **Project Management Tools:**
  - Archived or deleted project boards
  - Cancelled project exports
  - Historical snapshots

- **Version Control:**
  - Abandoned repositories
  - Unmerged branches
  - Experimental code

- **Documentation:**
  - Draft documents never completed
  - Planning materials for cancelled work
  - Meeting notes from discontinued projects

---

## Lifecycle Management

### Moving to Archived
Projects move here from **1.2.1.0 - Active Projects** when:
- Project is formally cancelled
- No activity for 6+ months with no plans to resume
- Project goals changed and original work is obsolete
- Resources no longer available to continue
- Priorities shifted and project deprioritized indefinitely

### Potential Reactivation
Some archived projects may eventually:
- Be moved back to Active if revived
- Inform new projects with similar goals
- Provide materials for different projects
- Teach lessons about what not to do

## Best Practices

1. **Document Why:** Always record why project was archived
2. **Capture Learnings:** Note what was learned from the experience
3. **Save Useful Bits:** Preserve anything that might be valuable later
4. **No Shame:** Failed projects are normal and educational
5. **Be Honest:** Document what went wrong truthfully
6. **Date It:** Record when and why it was archived
7. **Extract Value:** Find the lessons in the discontinuation

## Learning from Archived Projects

Archived projects provide:
- **Lessons Learned:** What to avoid in future projects
- **Idea Seeds:** Concepts that might work in different context
- **Time Savers:** Don't repeat the same mistakes
- **Realism:** Not every project succeeds, and that's okay
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify common failure points
- **Honest Assessment:** What types of projects to avoid
