## Privacy Considerations

### Default Privacy Level
- **Extremely Private:** Highest level of privacy protection
- **Owner Only:** Accessible only to the owner by default
- **Encrypted:** Should be encrypted at rest
- **Audit Logged:** Track all access attempts

### Data Sensitivity
- Identity documents enable identity theft if compromised
- Medical records are protected by HIPAA and privacy laws
- Financial documents contain sensitive account information
- These are among the most sensitive documents a person has

### Security Recommendations
- Enable encryption for this folder
- Use strong authentication to access
- Regular security audits
- Immediate notification of any access
- Never share these documents unless absolutely necessary
- Use secure methods if sharing is required
