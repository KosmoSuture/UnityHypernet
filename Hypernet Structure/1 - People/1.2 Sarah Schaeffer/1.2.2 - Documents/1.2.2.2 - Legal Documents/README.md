## Privacy Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
- Estate documents contain wealth information
- Legal agreements may have confidentiality clauses
- Court documents may contain private information
- Family legal documents are extremely personal
- Attorney correspondence is privileged

### Security Recommendations
- Encrypt legal documents
