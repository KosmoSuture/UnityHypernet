# 4 - Knowledge

**Status:** Foundational Structure - Ready for Implementation
**Purpose:** Universal knowledge organization and storage system for Hypernet
**Authority:** Master knowledge taxonomy for personal and collective intelligence

---

## What This Is

**Knowledge is where information becomes wisdom.**

The Knowledge node (4) is Hypernet's systematic approach to storing, organizing, and retrieving information across all domains. Unlike the raw data stored in personal nodes (1.*), business nodes (3.*), or objects (5.*), Knowledge represents curated, categorized, and contextualized information that builds understanding over time.

**Think of it as your external brain - organized, searchable, and infinitely extensible.**

---

## Core Concept

### Knowledge vs. Data vs. Objects

**Data (Personal Nodes 1.*):**
- Raw information: photos, messages, emails
- Belongs to specific individuals
- Privacy-controlled and access-restricted

**Objects (5.*):**
- Instantiated items: a specific photo, a particular document
- Defined by Object Type Registry (0.0)
- Structured according to schemas

**Knowledge (4.*):**
- Organized information: concepts, facts, insights
- Transcends individual ownership
- Accumulates and compounds over time
- Can be personal, shared, or universal

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Write atomic notes (one concept per note)
- Link liberally to related knowledge
- Use consistent tagging
- Add sources and citations
- Review and update regularly

### DON'T:
- Create massive monolithic documents
- Duplicate knowledge across notes
- Neglect linking (creates islands)
- Over-organize before capturing
- Store sensitive data in public knowledge

---

## Tools and Integrations

### Compatible with PKM Tools:
- Obsidian (Markdown + links)
- Roam Research (bidirectional linking)
- Notion (databases and views)
- Evernote (import/export)
- Bear (markdown notes)

### Export Formats:
- Markdown files
- HTML
- PDF
- JSON (structured data)
- Graph data (for visualization)

## Meta-Note

Knowledge is the compound interest of intelligence. The more you capture, organize, and link, the more valuable the system becomes. Knowledge in Hypernet is designed to grow with you, preserve your thinking, and make your accumulated wisdom accessible whenever you need it.

**Knowledge doesn't just store information. It builds understanding.**
