# 0.7.4 Incident Response Workflows

## Overview

Incident response workflows define how the Hypernet handles security breaches, system failures, disputes, and other problems. Rapid, transparent response protects users and maintains system integrity.

## Security Incident Response Workflow

### Purpose
Respond to security breaches and threats.
