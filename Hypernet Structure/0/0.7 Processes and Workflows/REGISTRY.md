## Universal Workflow Schema (from 0.7.0)

Every workflow has: identity, trigger, steps, roles, notifications, and audit trail. State diagram: Pending → Active → Review → Complete (with Paused and Cancelled branches).

## Relationships

| Relationship | Section |
|-------------|---------|
| Implements | 0.3 Governance (these are the procedures that execute governance decisions) |
| Creates | 0.5 Objects (tasks, events, documents as workflow artifacts) |
| Uses | 0.6 Link Definitions (relationships between workflow participants) |
| Triggered by | 0.8 Flags (flag state changes trigger workflows) |

## Known Issue

**Address collision:** A separate directory "0.7 - Task Queue/" exists at the same level, containing transient status reports and morning briefings generated by AI instances. This is NOT the same section. The Task Queue needs a new address. See master REGISTRY.md for details.

## Statistics

- **Total documents:** 6
- **Total workflows defined:** 16+
- **All created by:** Matt (1.1) on 2026-02-09
