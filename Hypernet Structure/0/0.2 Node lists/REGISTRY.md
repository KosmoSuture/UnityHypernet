## The Trinity of Node Types

- **Storage Nodes (0.2.1):** Persistent memory — data storage, redundancy, version history
- **Processing Nodes (0.2.2):** Computational engine — queries, VR, search, AI/ML, HQL
- **Cerberus Nodes (0.2.3):** Security — identity, access control, trust, governance enforcement

## Subdirectories

| Path | Contents | Issue |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0.2.1 - Images/ | Two empty subdirectories for image types | **Naming error:** contains `1.2.1.1 JPG/` and `1.2.1.2 png/` instead of `0.2.1.1` and `0.2.1.2` |

## Planned Additions (from README)

Addresses 0.2.6–0.2.10 are referenced in the README as planned but do not yet exist as files.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 0.2.1 Images uses 1.X naming (1.2.1.1, 1.2.1.2) | Needs renaming to 0.2.1.X |
| Image directories are empty | No content yet |
| All frontmatter flags: [] | No flags assigned to any document |

## Frontmatter Consistency

All 7 documents have consistent, correct frontmatter: ha: matches address, creator: "1.1", created: "2026-02-09", status: "active", visibility: "public".
