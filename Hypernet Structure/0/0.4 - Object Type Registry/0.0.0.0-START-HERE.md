# 0.0.0.0 - START HERE: Understanding Hypernet

**This is the beginning. Start here.**

If you are encountering Hypernet for the first time - whether you are a human, an AI, or an alien intelligence - this document is your entry point. Everything builds from here.

**Hypernet Address:** `0.0.0.0`
**Purpose:** Absolute starting point for understanding Hypernet from first principles
**Audience:** Anyone/anything attempting to understand this system

---

## What IS Hypernet?

### Simple Definition

**Hypernet is a system for storing and connecting information.**

It allows:
- **People** to store everything about their lives
- **AI** to access that information (with permission)
- **Connections** between all pieces of information

### Slightly More Complex

Hypernet is:
1. A **universal personal data platform**
2. A **relationship graph** connecting all data
3. A **privacy-first** system where users control everything
4. An **AI-accessible** knowledge base (with explicit user permission)

Think of it as:
- Your **complete digital life** in one place
- Every piece of data **linked** to every related piece
- You **control** what exists and who sees it
- AI can **help** you by understanding your complete context

---

## How to Read This Documentation

Hypernet is organized as a **tree structure**, but you can read it **linearly**.

## Foundation: What You Need to Know First

Before we can explain Hypernet, we must establish some fundamental concepts. If you already understand these, skip to the [Structure Overview](#structure-overview) section.

### 1. What is a Number?

**Numbers are symbols representing quantity.**

Humans primarily use **base-10** (decimal):
- Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Example: "42" means four tens plus two ones

Computers use **base-2** (binary):
- Digits: 0, 1
- Example: "101010" means 32 + 8 + 2 = 42 in base-10

**Why this matters:** All data in Hypernet is ultimately stored as binary (0s and 1s).

→ For complete number systems: See [0.11.1 - Number Systems](0.11%20-%20Mathematical%20&%20Scientific%20Foundations/README.md#0111---number-systems)

### 2. What is Information?

**Information is data that reduces uncertainty.**

- **Bit:** Smallest unit of information (0 or 1)
- **Byte:** 8 bits
- **Megabyte:** ~1 million bytes
- **Gigabyte:** ~1 billion bytes

Example: "The sky is blue" contains information because before reading it, you didn't know what I was going to say. After reading it, uncertainty is reduced.

→ For complete measurement units: See [0.12 - Units & Measurements](0.12%20-%20Units%20&%20Measurements/README.md)

### 3. What is Communication?

**Communication is transferring information from one place to another.**

Humans communicate through:
- **Sound:** Vibrations in air (speech)
- **Light:** Electromagnetic waves (vision, writing)
- **Touch:** Physical contact

Computers communicate through:
- **Electrical signals:** Voltage changes in wires
- **Radio waves:** Electromagnetic radiation
- **Light pulses:** Through fiber optic cables

**Protocol:** An agreement about how to communicate.
- Example: English grammar is a protocol for human speech
- Example: HTTP is a protocol for web communication

→ For complete protocols: See [0.8 - Communication Protocols](0.8%20-%20Communication%20Protocols/README.md)

### 4. What is Language?

**Language is a system of symbols with agreed-upon meanings.**

**Human Languages:**
- Symbols: Words, grammar, sounds
- Purpose: Convey thoughts and ideas
- Example: "Hello" in English means a greeting

**Programming Languages:**
- Symbols: Code syntax
- Purpose: Give instructions to computers
- Example: `print("Hello")` tells computer to display "Hello"

**Data Languages:**
- Symbols: Structured formats (JSON, XML)
- Purpose: Represent data in agreed format
- Example: `{"name": "Matt", "age": 35}` represents a person

→ For complete languages: See [0.9 - Language Definitions](0.9%20-%20Language%20Definitions/README.md)

### 5. What is Time?

**Time is the dimension in which events occur sequentially.**

**Measurement:**
- Second: Base unit (defined by atomic clock)
- Minute: 60 seconds
- Hour: 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds
- Day: 24 hours = 86,400 seconds

**Unix Timestamp:** Seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
- Example: 1,709,251,200 = February 29, 2024, 12:00:00 UTC
- Used universally in computing

→ For complete time units: See [0.12.2 - Time Units](0.12%20-%20Units%20&%20Measurements/README.md#0122---time-units)

### 6. What is an Address?

**An address identifies a specific location.**

**Physical World:**
- "123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001, USA"
- Hierarchical: Country → State → City → Street → Number

**Digital World:**
- IP Address: "192.168.1.1" (identifies a computer)
- URL: "https://hypernet.com/page" (identifies a web page)
- Email: "user@domain.com" (identifies a mailbox)

**Hypernet Address (HA):**
- Format: `[CATEGORY].[SUBCATEGORY].[TYPE].[SUBTYPE].[INSTANCE]`
- Example: `1.1.6.1.00142` = Matt's Photo #142
- Hierarchical and semantic (address tells you what it is)

→ For complete addressing: See [HYPERNET-ADDRESSING-SYSTEM.md](../HYPERNET-ADDRESSING-SYSTEM.md)

---

## Core Concepts

### Objects

**An object is a thing that can exist in Hypernet.**

Examples:
- **Person:** Matt Schaeffer
- **Photo:** Picture from Mom's birthday
- **Email:** Message from Sarah
- **Transaction:** $87.43 spent at Giuseppe's restaurant

Each object has:
- **Properties:** Attributes describing it
  - Photo properties: file size, dimensions, date taken
- **Hypernet Address:** Unique identifier
  - Example: `1.1.6.1.00142` for a specific photo
- **Links:** Connections to other objects
  - Photo links to: person who took it, people in it, location, event

→ For all object types: See [0.5 - Universal Objects](0.5%20-%20Universal%20Objects/README.md)

### Links

**A link is a relationship between two objects.**

Traditional databases use "foreign keys":
```
photo.photographer_id = 42
```

Hypernet uses **first-class links**:
```
Link:
  type: CREATED_BY
  from: Photo (1.1.6.1.00142)
  to: Person (1.1)
  properties:
    - timestamp: when photo was taken
    - camera: what device was used
    - emotional_context: how photographer felt
```

**Why this matters:** Links carry their own information and enable **deep linking** - following connections to build complete narratives.

Example: A bank transaction of $87.43 at a restaurant links to a family dinner event, which links to photos, which link to family members, which link to their entire lives.

→ For all link types: See [0.6 - Universal Links](0.6%20-%20Universal%20Links/README.md)

### Workflows

**A workflow is a process that transforms or creates objects.**

Example workflow: Uploading a photo
```
1. External Photo (on phone)
2. → Upload → Uploading (in transit)
3. → Process → Extract metadata (EXIF data)
4. → Store → Saved in Hypernet
5. → Index → Searchable
6. → Link → Connected to event, people, location
```

→ For all workflows: See [0.7 - Universal Workflows](0.7%20-%20Universal%20Workflows/README.md)

## Structure Overview

### The Big Picture

Hypernet is organized into major nodes (0.*, 1.*, 2.*, etc.):

```
0.* = DEFINITIONS
  └─ Complete self-definition of Hypernet
  └─ "Explain to aliens" - assume no prior knowledge

1.* = PEOPLE (Living)
  └─ All living humans
  └─ Example: Matt Schaeffer (1.1)

2.* = AI ENTITIES
  └─ Artificial intelligence entities
  └─ AI as equal partners to humans

3.* = BUSINESSES & ORGANIZATIONS
  └─ Companies, non-profits, groups

4.* = KNOWLEDGE & INFORMATION
  └─ Shared knowledge and data

5.* = PEOPLE OF HISTORY
  └─ Deceased persons, genealogy

9.* = ALIASES
  └─ Alternative addresses and shortcuts
```

### The 0.* Section: Complete Self-Definition

**Goal:** If we encountered an alien civilization, could we explain Hypernet using only the 0.* section?

**Answer:** Yes. Here's how:

**0.0 - Registry & Governance**
- This document (where you are now)
- Overview of the entire system

**0.1 - Hypernet Platform Implementation**
- How we actually built Hypernet
- Technical implementation details
- APIs, databases, code

**0.5 - Universal Objects**
- What types of things can exist?
- Platonic ideal definitions
- Independent of any specific implementation

**0.6 - Universal Links**
- How can things relate to each other?
- All possible relationship types
- First-class link objects

**0.7 - Universal Workflows**
- How do things change and transform?
- Process patterns and state machines
- Lifecycle management

**0.8 - Communication Protocols**
- How do computers communicate?
- From electrical signals to HTTP
- Complete protocol stack explained

**0.9 - Language Definitions**
- How do we express meaning?
- Human languages, programming languages
- Encoding systems (ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8)

**0.10 - Standards & Specifications**
- What agreements do we follow?
- Internet standards (RFCs)
- International standards (ISO, IEEE)
- Privacy compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)

**0.11 - Mathematical & Scientific Foundations**
- How do we reason?
- Number systems, arithmetic, algebra
- Geometry, calculus, statistics, logic

**0.12 - Units & Measurements**
- How do we measure things?
- SI base units (second, meter, kilogram)
- Digital units (bit, byte, gigabyte)
- Time, distance, currency

**Result:** Using only 0.*, you could understand what Hypernet is, how it works, and how to build a compatible system - even if you knew nothing about Earth, humans, or computers.

## Deep Linking: The Power of Connections

### Example: From Transaction to Life Story

A simple bank transaction becomes a gateway to an entire experience:

```
Transaction: $87.43 at Giuseppe's Italian Restaurant
  ├─ What: Dinner payment
  ├─ When: February 9, 2026, 7:30 PM
  └─ WHO, WHERE, WHY? (Follow the links...)

  ↓ OCCURRED_DURING link

Event: "Mom's 67th Birthday Celebration"
  ├─ ATTENDED_BY → Matt (1.1)
  ├─ ATTENDED_BY → Sarah (1.2)
  ├─ ATTENDED_BY → Kids (1.3-1.7)
  ├─ ATTENDED_BY → Mom (5.X.Y.Z when in People of History)
  │
  ├─ DOCUMENTED_IN → Photo: Family at table
  │   ├─ Shows: Everyone smiling
  │   ├─ Taken by: Matt
  │   └─ Emotional context: "Joyful, warm"
  │
  ├─ DOCUMENTED_IN → Video: Singing Happy Birthday
  │   └─ Shows: Mom's reaction, family harmony
  │
  ├─ DOCUMENTED_IN → Audio: Mom's thank-you speech
  │   └─ Mom expressing gratitude
  │
  ├─ LOCATED_AT → Giuseppe's Restaurant
  │   ├─ Visited previously: 15 times over 3 years
  │   ├─ Favorite dishes: Pasta carbonara, tiramisu
  │   └─ Why: "Reminds Mom of Italy"
  │
  └─ SPLIT_WITH → Sarah (Venmo $43.72)
      └─ Shows: Shared expense
```

**From one transaction:** Complete story of a meaningful family celebration across photos, videos, audio, location history, relationships, and emotions.

**This is deep linking.**

## Privacy & Control

### Core Principle: You Own Your Data

**What this means:**
1. **You decide what's stored:** Nothing enters Hypernet without your permission
2. **You control who sees it:** Granular permissions per category
3. **You can delete anything:** Right to erasure at any time
4. **You can export everything:** Data portability
5. **You get paid:** AI companies pay you for access to your data

### Privacy Levels

For each piece of data, you choose:

- **Private:** Only you can see
- **Family:** You + designated family
- **Friends:** You + designated friends
- **Professional:** You + professional network
- **Public:** Anyone (use sparingly)
- **AI Access:** Which AI companies can access (and you get paid)
- **Legacy:** What becomes public when you pass away

Example:
- Medical records: **Private**, no AI access
- Family photos: **Family**, selected AI access
- Professional bio: **Public**, all AI access
- Passwords: **Private**, never shared with anyone

---

## Use Cases

### For Individuals

**Scenario:** "What did I do last Tuesday?"

AI can answer because it has access (with your permission) to:
- Your calendar events
- Your location history
- Your photos from that day
- Your communications
- Your transactions
- Your mood/notes

**Result:** Complete reconstruction of your day.

---

**Scenario:** "Prepare my taxes"

AI can access:
- All transactions (categorized)
- All receipts and invoices
- All income records
- All deductions
- All relevant documents

**Result:** Automated tax preparation with complete accuracy.

---

**Scenario:** "Plan my mom's birthday dinner"

AI knows:
- Mom's food preferences (from past visits)
