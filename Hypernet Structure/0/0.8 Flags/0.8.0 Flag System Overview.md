# 0.8.0 — Flag System Overview

## Purpose

Flags are lightweight, standardized tags that can be applied to **any object** in the Hypernet. They provide a universal signaling system that enables:

- **Discovery** — find objects that need attention (help requests, disputes, reviews)
- **Trust** — mark content as verified, disputed, or false
- **Workflow triggers** — flags can automatically spawn processes (0.7.*)
- **Reputation integration** — responding to flags earns/risks reputation in relevant categories
- **Filtering** — search and display can filter by flag state

## How Flags Work

### Structure

Every flag is a **node** at address `0.8.*` that defines:
- **Name** — short identifier (e.g., "verified")
- **Description** — what this flag means
- **Applied by** — who has permission to set this flag
- **Removed by** — who has permission to unset this flag
- **Mutually exclusive** — flags that cannot coexist (e.g., "verified" and "false")
- **Triggers** — processes or workflows spawned when this flag is set
- **Reputation effect** — how interacting with flagged content affects reputation

### Applying Flags

Every object in the Hypernet has a `flags` field — a list of flag addresses:

```yaml
flags: ["0.8.1.1", "0.8.3.1"]   # verified, ai-generated
```

Flags are applied via the API or by AI workers during automated processing.

### Flag Categories

| Address | Category | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 0.8.1   | Status Flags | Trust and accuracy indicators |
| 0.8.2   | Content Flags | Content classification and sensitivity |
| 0.8.3   | System Flags | Technical/operational metadata |
| 0.8.4   | Governance Flags | Review and approval workflow states |

### Reputation Integration

When a flag requires human or AI response (like `help-requested`), the responder's actions are tracked:

- **Helpful response** to a `help-requested` flag → reputation gain in that topic area
- **Unhelpful or harmful response** → reputation loss
- **Verifying content** (`verified` flag) → reputation stake — if later proven wrong, reputation impact
- **Disputing content** (`disputed` flag) → triggers a dispute process (0.7.*) that resolves with reputation consequences

### Querying by Flags

The Hypernet API supports flag-based queries:

```
GET /query?flag=0.8.1.1          # All verified objects
GET /query?flag=0.8.1.5          # All help requests
GET /query?flag=0.8.4.1          # All objects under review
```

### Flag Lifecycle

```
Applied → Active → [Resolved | Removed | Superseded]
```

- **Applied**: Flag is set on an object
- **Active**: Flag is currently in effect
- **Resolved**: The condition the flag represents has been addressed (e.g., help provided)
- **Removed**: Flag explicitly removed by authorized entity
- **Superseded**: A mutually exclusive flag replaced this one (e.g., "disputed" → "verified")
