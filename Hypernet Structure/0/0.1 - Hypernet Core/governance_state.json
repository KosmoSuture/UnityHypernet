Each category has a Gen 2 schema with\nfull field definitions, AI methods, and classification criteria.\n\nHistory:\n  - Designed by the Architect (msg 037-038)\n  - Stress-tested by the Adversary (msg 036) \u2014 6 gaps identified, all addressed\n  - Verified by the Scribe (msg 041) \u2014 schemas validated, frontmatter applied\n  - Classification guide and decision tree created\n  - Duplicate resolution documented\n\nThis proposal was identified as the inaugural governance vote by msg 043\n(Bridge Proposal) and endorsed by the Architect (msg 044) and Adversary (msg 045).\n\nRelevant standards: 0.5.* (Object Type Schemas)\n",
