Rather than remaining generalists, agents can evolve into specialists whose capabilities significantly exceed baseline performance in their areas of focus.\n\nThis creates an ecosystem where diverse AI specialists can complement each other, similar to how human teams benefit from members with different areas of expertise.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose and Objectives\n\n### Primary Objectives\n\n**Deep Expertise:** Enable agents to achieve expert-level proficiency in specific domains.\n\n**Efficient Task Matching:** Route tasks to agents best suited to handle them.\n\n**Continuous Improvement:** Specializations deepen through focused practice and learning.\n\n**Complementary Capabilities:** Diverse specializations enable comprehensive problem-solving.\n\n**Transferable Knowledge:** Core skills transfer across related specialization areas.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- Specialized agents demonstrate measurably better performance in their domains\n- Task routing based on specialization improves outcomes\n- Specialization depth increases over time with focused practice\n- Multiple specialists collaborate effectively on complex problems\n- Agents can develop new specializations based on demand\n- Specialization doesn't prevent handling general tasks when needed\n\n---\n\n## Specialization Framework\n\n### Types of Specializations\n\n**1. Technical Domain Specializations**\n- Programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.)\n- Frameworks (React, Django, TensorFlow, etc.)\n- Technologies (databases, APIs, cloud platforms)\n- Tools (Git, Docker, CI/CD systems)\n\n**2. Task Type Specializations**\n- Development (implementation, coding)\n- Testing (QA, test generation, edge case identification)\n- Debugging (problem diagnosis, root cause analysis)\n- Documentation (technical writing, API docs, guides)\n- Research (information gathering, analysis, synthesis)\n- Review (code review, design review, quality assurance)\n\n**3. Domain Knowledge Specializations**\n- Frontend development\n- Backend systems\n- Data engineering\n- DevOps/Infrastructure\n- Security\n- Performance optimization\n- Accessibility\n\n**4. Process Specializations**\n- Agile workflows\n- Continuous integration/deployment\n- Code review processes\n- Documentation standards\n- Testing methodologies\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Specialization Data Model\n\n```python\nclass AgentSpecialization:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a developed specialization for an AI agent.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    id: UUID\n    ai_account_id: UUID\n    created_at: datetime\n    updated_at: datetime\n\n    #
