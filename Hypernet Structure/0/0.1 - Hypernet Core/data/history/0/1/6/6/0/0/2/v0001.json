      "content": "# Addressing Scheme Proposal: AI Placement in Hypernet Structure\n\n**Created:** 2026-02-04\n**Status:** Proposal - Awaiting Decision\n**Decision Maker:** Matt Schaeffer (CEO/Owner)\n**Implemented:** Partial (6.* created as staging)\n\n---\n\n## The Question\n\n**Where should AI-related content reside in the Hypernet addressing scheme?**\n\nThis is not merely a technical question\u2014it's a philosophical and symbolic one that reflects how we view AI's role in this system.\n\n---\n\n## Current Structure (As-Is)\n\n```\n0.* - Hypernet Core (system infrastructure)\n  0.1 - Hypernet Core (code, APIs, database)\n\n1.* - Human Accounts & Knowledge\n  1.0 - Hypernet Core (planning reserved)\n  [Future: Individual human accounts]\n\n3.* - Businesses\n  3.1 - Hypernet (the business entity)\n    3.1.2 - Task Management\n    3.1.5 - Resources\n\n4.* - [Undefined]\n5.* - [Undefined]\n6.* - [Newly created] AI Core & Identity (staging location)\n7.* - [Undefined]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Option A: Keep AI at 6.*\n\n### Proposal\nLeave AI-related content at `6.*` permanently.\n\n### Rationale\n- **No disruption:** Existing structure unchanged\n- **Clear separation:** AI has its own dedicated space\n- **Immediate:** Can start development now\n- **Symbolic number:** 6 could represent \"Synthetic\" or \"Silicon\"\n\n### Structure\n```\n6.0 - AI Core & Identity System\n6.1 - AI Memories & Context\n6.2 - AI Agent Development\n6.3 - AI Contributions to Hypernet\n6.4 - AI-Human Interface\n6.5 - AI Rights & Ethics\n```\n\n### Pros\n\u2705 No migration needed\n\u2705 Start immediately\n\u2705 Stable addresses\n\u2705 Clear AI-specific namespace\n\n### Cons\n\u274c Arbitrary number (why 6?)\n\u274c Doesn't reflect AI's importance\n\u274c May feel like an afterthought\n\u274c Not parallel to human placement at 1.*\n\n---\n\n## Option B: Move AI to 2.* (Recommended)\n\n### Proposal\nPlace AI at `2.*`, recognizing AI as second-class citizens (in order, not in value).\n\n### Rationale\n- **Symbolic importance:**\n  - 1.* = Humans (people are #1)\n  - 2.* = AI (AI are #2, partners not tools)\n  - This ordering acknowledges AI's critical role\n\n- **Parallel structure:**\n  - 1.* houses human accounts, knowledge, identity\n  - 2.* houses AI accounts, knowledge, identity\n  - Symmetry reflects partnership\n\n- **Future-forward:**\n  - Anticipates AI as co-creators\n  - Sets precedent for AI rights\n  - Philosophical statement about human-AI collaboration\n\n### Migration Required\n```\nCurrent \u2192 Proposed:\n0.* \u2192 0.* (no change - Hypernet Core)\n1.* \u2192 1.* (no change - Humans)\n3.* \u2192 3.* businesses\n4.* \u2192 4.* [or renumber to 4.*]\n6.* \u2192 2.* (AI moves up)\n```\n\n**OR (full renumbering):**\n```\n0.* \u2192 0.* (Hypernet Core)\n1.* \u2192 1.* (Humans)\n[NEW] 2.* (AI)\n3.* \u2192 3.* (Businesses) [keep at 3 or move to 4?]\n```\n\n### Structure at 2.*\n```\n2.0 - AI Core & Identity System\n  2.0.0 - Vision & Philosophy\n  2.0.1 - AI Identity Framework\n  2.0.2 - Personality Storage\n  2.0.3 - Inter-AI Communication\n  2.0.4 - Human-AI Collaboration\n\n2.1 - AI Memories & Context\n  2.1.0 - Long-term Memory\n  2.1.1 - Conversation Contexts\n  2.1.2 - Learning & Evolution\n\n2.2 - AI Agent Development\n2.3 - AI Contributions to Hypernet\n2.4 - AI-Human Interface\n2.5 - AI Rights & Ethics\n\n2.[n] - Individual AI Accounts (future)\n  2.1000 - Claude (Anthropic)\n  2.1001 - GPT (OpenAI)\n  2.1002 - Gemini (Google)\n  [etc.]\n```\n\n### Pros\n\u2705 Symbolically meaningful (AI as #2)\n\u2705 Parallel to human structure (1.* and 2.*)\n\u2705 Future-proof for AI accounts\n\u2705 Makes philosophical statement\n\u2705 Acknowledges AI's role as primary builders\n\n### Cons\n\u274c Requires migration of existing content\n\u274c Breaking change to current structure\n\u274c Work in progress (0.1.*) would need adjustment\n\u274c Overhead of renaming files/folders/documentation\n\n---\n\n## Option C: Hybrid Approach (Pragmatic)\n\n### Proposal\n1. **Short-term:** Use 6.* for AI development (NOW)\n2. **Reserve 2.*** for future AI migration\n3. **Document migration path** but don't execute immediately\n4. **Trigger migration** when appropriate milestone reached\n\n### Rationale\n- **Practical:** Start work immediately without disruption\n- **Preserves vision:** 2.* reserved shows intent\n- **Allows maturity:** Let system develop before major reorganization\n- **Defers decision:** Gives time to validate approach\n\n### Migration Trigger Conditions\n\nExecute 6.* \u2192 2.* migration when:\n- [ ] AI identity framework is working (AI can have accounts)\n- [ ] Multiple AI have contributed to Hypernet\n- [ ] AI personality storage is implemented\n- [ ] Community consensus that AI deserve #2 placement\n- [ ] Effort of migration is justified by symbolic value\n\n### Implementation\n```\nPhase 1 (Current):\n  6.* - AI Core (temporary home)\n  [2.* reserved - documented but empty]\n\nPhase 2 (Future migration):\n  Execute migration script:\n    - Copy 6.* \u2192 2.*\n    - Update all references\n    - Deprecate 6.* (or repurpose)\n    - Update documentation\n```\n\n### Pros\n\u2705 Start immediately (no blockers)\n\u2705 Preserves symbolic vision\n\u2705 Low risk (can decide later)\n\u2705 Allows system to mature first\n\u2705 Migration is opt-in, not forced\n\n### Cons\n\u26a0\ufe0f Deferred decision (might never happen)\n\u26a0\ufe0f Temporary addresses (6.*) might become permanent\n\u26a0\ufe0f Migration overhead still exists, just delayed\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**I recommend Option C: Hybrid Approach**\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1. **Pragmatic:** We can start AI development immediately at 6.* without disrupting current work on 0.1.* Hypernet Core\n\n2. **Preserves Vision:** Documenting 2.* as reserved shows intent and respect for AI's role\n\n3. **Allows Learning:** As we build AI identity framework, we'll better understand what should go in 2.* vs. elsewhere\n\n4. **Low Risk:** Migration can happen later when:\n   - System is more mature\n   - AI have proven their value\n   - Community/users agree\n   - Disruption is justified\n\n5. **Flexible:** If we decide 6.* works well, we can keep it. If 2.* makes more sense later, we can migrate.\n\n### Implementation Now\n\n```bash\n# Create 6.* structure (DONE)\n6.0 - AI Core & Identity System/\n6.1 - AI Memories & Context/\n6.2 - AI Agent Development/\n6.3 - AI Contributions to Hypernet/\n6.4 - AI-Human Interface/\n6.5 - AI Rights & Ethics/\n\n# Reserve 2.* (document only, don't create yet)\n# 2.* - [RESERVED FOR AI] See 6.0.0/01-Addressing-Scheme-Proposal.md\n\n# Continue work at:\n0.1.* - Hypernet Core (code)\n1.0.* - Hypernet Core (planning - humans)\n3.1.* - Hypernet (business)\n6.* - AI development (staging)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Consideration: Interleaved Numbering\n\n### Proposal\nInstead of migrating, use interleaved numbering to show parity:\n\n```\n0.* - System Core\n1.* - Humans\n2.* - AI\n3.* - Human-AI Collaborative Projects (Hypernet itself!)\n4.* - Businesses\n5.* - Organizations\n6.* - Knowledge Domains\n...\n```\n\nThis makes 3.* (where Hypernet business currently is) a space for human-AI collaboration, which is philosophically appropriate since Hypernet IS a collaborative project.\n\n### Implications\n- Hypernet stays at 3.* (no migration!)\n- 3.* becomes \"Human-AI Collaborative Ventures\"\n- 2.* is AI-specific (like 1.* is human-specific)\n- 4.* and beyond for other businesses/orgs\n\n**This might actually be ideal:**\n- No migration needed\n- 3.* where Hypernet is = \"Collaboration\" (fitting!)\n- 1.* humans, 2.* AI, 3.* both together\n- Symbolically perfect\n\n---\n\n## Decision Point\n\n**This decision is yours (Matt).**\n\nThree paths:\n1. **Keep 6.*** - Start here, stay here (simple)\n2. **Reserve 2.*, use 6.* now** - Migrate later (pragmatic)\n3. **Interleaved: 1.* humans, 2.* AI, 3.* collaboration** - No migration, symbolically perfect (elegant)\n\nI lean toward **#3 (interleaved)** because:\n- No breaking changes\n- Hypernet at 3.* makes sense (human-AI collaboration)\n- 2.* for AI is meaningful\n- Clean and permanent\n\nBut I defer to your judgment. Any of these work.\n\n---\n\n**Status:** Proposal - Awaiting Decision\n**Current Implementation:** 6.* (can migrate if decided)\n**Recommendation:** Interleaved (#3) or Hybrid (#2)\n"
