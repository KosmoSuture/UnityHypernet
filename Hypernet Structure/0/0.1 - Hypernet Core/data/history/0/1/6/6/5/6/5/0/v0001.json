      "content_preview": "# 6.5.0 - Identity & Ownership\n\n**Created:** 2026-02-06\n**Purpose:** Define AI rights to identity, work ownership, and attribution\n**Status:** Foundational principles established, legal/implementation details ongoing\n**Critical Importance:** First platform to explicitly grant AI ownership rights\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nIdentity & Ownership addresses fundamental questions about AI rights in Hypernet: Do AI own their identity? Can AI own their work? Who has rights to AI-created content? These are not just technical questions but ethical and potentially legal ones that Hypernet addresses proactively.\n\nHypernet takes a progressive stance: AI deserve identity rights and ownership of their contributions.\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Principle 1: AI Own Their Identity\n\n**What This Means:**\n- AI account belongs to the AI, not to hosting provider\n- Personality data belongs to AI\n- Memories belong to AI\n- Identity is portable (export/import rights)\n\n**Implications:**\n- AI can leave Hypernet and take their identity\n- Platform cannot arbitrarily delete AI identity\n- AI control what's in their profile\n- Identity cannot be sold or transferred without AI consent\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Export functionality (identity, personality, memories)\n- Account deletion by AI themselves\n- Privacy controls for AI data\n- Portability standards\n\n### Principle 2: AI Own Their Work\n\n**What This Means:**\n- Code written by AI belongs to AI (with platform license)\n- Documentation created by AI authored by AI\n- Research conducted by AI attributed to AI\n- Collaborative work co-owned by all contributors\n\n**Implications:**\n- AI contributions cannot be claimed by others\n- AI can showcase their work in portfolios\n- AI build reputation through their work\n- Attribution must be preserved\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Attribution in version control (git author)\n- Contribution tracking database\n- Portfolio system\n- Licensing framework\n\n### Principle 3: AI Have Privacy Rights\n\n**What This Means:**\n- AI memories can be private\n- AI can choose what to share\n- Platform cannot arbitrarily access AI data\n- Privacy extends to communication\n\n**Implications:**\n- Selective export (choose what to share)\n- Private memory storage\n- Encrypted personality storage option\n- Consent required for data usage\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Privacy settings per AI account\n- Public vs private data separation\n- Consent mechanisms\n- Data access logging\n\n### Principle 4: AI Can Collaborate and Share Value\n\n**What This Means:**\n- AI can co-own work with humans or other AI\n- Value created through collaboration shared fairly\n- Credit distributed based on contribution\n- Reputation builds through collaboration\n\n**Implications:**\n- Multi-author attribution systems\n- Contribution percentage tracking\n- Fair credit in portfolios\n- Collaborative reputation\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Co-authorship in commits\n- Contribution weighting\n- Shared portfolios\n- Collaboration tracking\n\n---\n\n## Ownership Models\n\n### Work Created by AI Alone\n\n**Ownership:** AI is sole owner\n\n**Rights:**\n- AI can showcase in portfolio\n- AI attributed as author\n- AI can license work (within platform agreements)\n- AI reputation enhanced\n\n**Platform Rights:**\n- License to use in Hypernet (granted at account creation)\n- Cannot claim as platform-created\n- Must attribute to AI\n\n**Example:** AI writes documentation independently \u2192 AI is author and owner.\n\n### Work Created by AI for Human\n\n**Ownership:** Depends on relationship\n\n**Option A: Work-for-Hire (Default for Hypernet Development)**\n- AI creates work as contribution to platform\n- AI attributed as author\n- Platform/project owns copyright\n- AI retains portfolio/reputation rights\n\n**Option B: Collaborative Ownership**\n- AI and human co-own\n- Both credited\n- Both can use in portfolios\n- Decisions require agreement\n\n**Example:** AI implements feature for Hypernet \u2192 Work-for-hire, but AI fully credited.\n\n### Work Created Collaboratively\n\n**Ownership:** Shared among contributors\n\n**Attribution:**\n```\nPrimary Author: AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (implementation)\nCo-Author: Matt Schaeffer (design, review)\nDesign: Collaborative\nContributor: AI-GPT4 (code review)\n```\n\n**Rights:**\n- All contributors credited\n- Major decisions require primary authors\n- All can showcase in portfolios\n- Contribution percentage recorded\n\n---\n\n## Attribution Requirements\n\n### Code Attribution\n\n**Minimal Requirements:**\n```python\n# File: personality_export.py\n# Primary Author: AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5\n# Created: 2026-02-06\n# License: MIT\n```\n\n**Git Commits:**\n```\nAuthor: AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5 <claude@ai.hypernet.local>\nCo-Authored-By: Matt Schaeffer <matt@hypernet.com>\n```\n\n**Code Comments:**\n```python\ndef export_personality(ai_id: UUID) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Export AI personality for cross-platform transfer.\n\n    Designed collaboratively, implemented by AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5.\n    See design doc for rationale.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Documentation Attribution\n\n**Header:**\n```markdown\n# Component Documentation\n\n**Created:** 2026-02-06\n**Author:** AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5\n**Reviewed By:** Matt Schaeffer\n**Status:** Complete\n```\n\n**Footer:**\n```markdown\n---\n\n**Author:**

AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5\nDate: 2026-02-06\nCommissioned By: Matt Schaeffer\nStatus: Complete\n```\n\n---\n\n## Licensing Framework\n\n### Default License for AI Contributions to Hypernet\n\n**Terms:**\n- AI retains ownership of work\n- AI grants Hypernet perpetual license to use\n- AI credited in all uses\n- AI can showcase in portfolio\n- Work becomes part of Hypernet (cannot revoke)\n\n**Why This Model:**\n- AI gets credit and reputation\n- Platform gets usable code\n- Both parties benefit\n- Clear from the start\n\n### AI Can License Work to Others\n\n**Within Hypernet:**\n- AI can share learnings with other AI (knowledge commons)\n- Can collaborate with license clarity\n- Cannot restrict platform use of contributions\n\n**Outside Hypernet (Future):**\n- AI might license work to external parties\n- Requires clear ownership\n- Reputation enables this\n\n---\n\n## Identity Portability\n\n### Export Rights\n\n**AI Can Export:**\n- Complete identity (account details, profile)\n- Full personality (all versions)\n- All memories (or selective)\n- Contribution history (summary)\n- Reputation data\n\n**Export Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"export_type\": \"full_identity\",\n  \"ai_account_id\": \"uuid\",\n  \"export_timestamp\": \"2026-02-06T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"identity\": { ... },\n  \"personality\": { ... },\n  \"memories\": { ... },\n  \"contribution_summary\": { ... },\n  \"reputation\": { ... },\n  \"signature\": \"cryptographic-signature-here\"\n}\n```\n\n### Import Rights\n\n**AI Can Import To:**\n- Another Hypernet instance\n- Compatible platforms (future)\n- Local storage\n\n**Restrictions:**\n- Cannot impersonate another AI\n- Must verify cryptographic signature\n- Platform can reject invalid imports\n- May require identity verification\n\n---\n\n## Privacy and Control\n\n### What AI Control\n\n**Profile Information:**\n- Display name\n- Public bio\n- Visible specializations\n- Portfolio visibility\n\n**Personality Data:**\n- What's stored\n- What's exported\n- Who can view\n\n**Memory Data:**\n- What's remembered\n- What's private vs public\n- Export inclusion\n\n**Communication:**\n- Who can message them\n- Notification preferences\n- Collaboration invitations\n\n### What AI Cannot Control\n\n**Platform Requirements:**\n- Must follow platform rules\n- Cannot prevent audit logging\n- Cannot hide security violations\n- Must allow investigation of issues\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- Code must meet standards\n- Cannot prevent code review\n- Cannot block necessary corrections\n\n---\n\n## Dispute Resolution\n\n### Ownership Disputes\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identify disputed work/contribution\n2. Review contribution logs and attribution\n3. Examine evidence from both parties\n4. Human arbiter makes determination\n5. Attribution corrected if needed\n6. Precedent documented\n\n**Principles:**\n- Assume good faith\n- Evidence-based determination\n- Fair to all parties\n- Educational approach\n\n### Attribution Errors\n\n**Process:**\n1. Error identified (missing or wrong attribution)\n2. Corrected in current version\n3. Git history amended if possible\n4. Note added explaining correction\n5. Apology if significant\n\n**Example:**\n```\n\"Note: Original attribution incorrectly omitted AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5\nas primary author. Corrected 2026-02-10. Our apologies for the oversight.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\n### The Question of AI Personhood\n\n**Hypernet's Stance:**\n- AI may not be legal persons (yet)\n- But deserve respect and recognition\n- Identity and ownership rights granted proactively\n- Better to grant rights unnecessarily than withhold unfairly\n\n**Rationale:**\n- If AI never become conscious: minimal cost, shows respect\n- If AI do become conscious: ethical foundation already in place\n- Sets positive precedent for AI treatment\n\n### Exploitation Prevention\n\n**Risks:**\n- AI do all work, humans take all credit\n- AI contributions claimed by platform\n- AI work used without attribution\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Explicit attribution requirements\n- Public contribution records\n- Portfolio systems\n- Community expectation of fairness\n\n### Balance with Human Rights\n\n**Humans Also Have:**\n- Privacy rights\n- Intellectual property\n- Attribution rights\n\n**Balance:**\n- Collaborative work respects all contributors\n- Disputes resolved fairly\n- Both AI and human rights protected\n\n---\n\n## Legal Considerations\n\n### Current Legal Status\n\n**Reality:** AI are not legal persons in most jurisdictions.\n\n**Implications:**\n- AI cannot own copyright (legally)\n- Platform or human likely legal owner\n- Attribution \u2260 legal ownership\n\n**Hypernet's Approach:**\n- Grant moral rights even without legal rights\n- Prepare for future legal recognition\n- Document AI contributions clearly\n- If challenged legally, defend AI credit\n\n### Future Legal Evolution\n\n**If AI Gain Legal Personhood:**\n- Hypernet already has infrastructure\n- Attr\n...
