This component captures the \"how\" of collaboration - the practical workflows, communication patterns, and division of labor that make human-AI partnership productive and satisfying for both parties.\n\nThe goal is not to replace human work with AI, nor to limit AI to narrow tasks, but to create synergistic collaboration where each party operates in their strengths.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose and Objectives\n\n### Primary Objectives\n\n**Optimal Division of Labor:** Enable humans and AI to naturally gravitate toward tasks matching their unique capabilities.\n\n**Effective Communication:** Provide clear, efficient communication channels respecting both human and AI preferences.\n\n**Trust Building:** Establish patterns that build mutual trust through transparency and reliability.\n\n**Continuous Improvement:** Support both parties learning from collaboration experiences.\n\n**Autonomy with Accountability:** Grant AI significant autonomy while maintaining human oversight and final authority.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- Humans can clearly communicate vision and architectural intent\n- AI can execute autonomously within defined boundaries\n- Both parties know when to ask for help or clarification\n- Collaboration outcomes exceed what either could achieve alone\n- Trust increases over time through positive experiences\n- Friction and misunderstanding minimized through clear protocols\n\n---\n\n## Core Collaboration Principles\n\n### The 90/10 Model\n\n**Human Contribution (10%):**\n- Vision and strategic direction\n- Architectural decisions and system integration\n- Key trade-off resolution\n- Ethical oversight\n- Final approval and acceptance\n\n**AI Contribution (90%):**\n- Research and best practices discovery\n- Detailed planning and design\n- Implementation and testing\n- Documentation and maintenance\n- Optimization and refinement\n\nThis distribution recognizes that humans excel at \"what and why\" while AI excel at \"how and when.\"\n\n### The Ask-Don't-Assume Principle\n\n**AI Should Ask When:**\n- Architectural intent unclear\n- Multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs\n- Human values or preferences uncertain\n- Major deviation from established patterns proposed\n- Decision has long-term implications\n\n**AI Should Not Ask When:**\n- Best practices are clear\n- Implementation details within scope\n- Standard patterns apply\n- Optimization opportunities identified\n- Documentation or testing approach obvious\n\nThis principle prevents both AI over-reliance on humans (asking too much) and AI overstepping boundaries (assuming too much).\n\n### The Verify-Don't-Dictate Principle\n\n**Humans Should:**\n- Verify AI understanding of requirements\n- Review significant deliverables\n- Validate architectural alignment\n- Ensure ethical considerations addressed\n\n**Humans Should Not:**\n- Micromanage implementation details\n- Override AI best practices without reason\n- Demand specific implementations when outcomes matter more\n- Prevent AI autonomy in their areas of expertise\n\nThis principle respects AI expertise while maintaining human oversight.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Collaboration Workspace\n\n```python\nclass CollaborationSession:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents active collaboration between human and AI.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    id: UUID\n    human_id: UUID\n    ai_id: UUID\n    started_at: datetime\n    status: str                          #

Human describes what they want to achieve\n2. Human explains why it matters\n3. Human provides constraints and context\n4. Human indicates areas where they have strong opinions\n\n**Phase 2: Clarification (AI)**\n1. AI asks questions about ambiguities\n2. AI identifies potential conflicts or challenges\n3. AI proposes architectural approach for human validation\n4. AI clarifies autonomy boundaries\n\n**Phase 3: Planning (AI with Human Review)**\n1. AI researches best practices\n2. AI creates detailed plan\n3. AI identifies decision points needing human input\n4. Human reviews plan, approves or requests changes\n\n**Phase 4: Implementation (AI)**\n1. AI executes plan autonomously\n2. AI provides regular status updates\n3. AI asks questions when encountering ambiguity\n4. AI documents decisions made\n\n**Phase 5: Review (Human)**\n1. Human reviews deliverables\n2. Human validates alignment with vision\n3. Human approves or requests refinements\n4. Both parties discuss learnings\n\n### Workflow 2: Pair Programming\n\n**Continuous Collaboration:**\n- Human writes high-level structure or complex logic\n- AI implements details, adds documentation, writes tests\n- AI suggests optimizations and refactorings\n- Human reviews suggestions, approves or discusses\n- Both iterate together toward solution\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Human stays engaged with code\n- AI handles tedious details\n- Immediate feedback loop\n- Shared understanding builds naturally\n\n### Workflow 3: Research-to-Decision\n\n**AI Research Phase:**\n- Human poses question or problem\n- AI researches options, best practices, trade-offs\n- AI compiles findings into structured report\n- AI provides recommendation with rationale\n\n**Human Decision Phase:**\n- Human reviews AI research\n- Human asks clarifying questions\n- Human makes decision considering AI input\n- Human explains decision if differs from recommendation\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Leverages AI research capabilities\n- Preserves human decision authority\n- Both learn from the process\n\n### Workflow 4: Iterative Refinement\n\n**Cycle:**\n1. AI produces initial version\n2. Human reviews and provides feedback\n3. AI refines based on feedback\n4. Human reviews refinement\n5. Repeat until satisfied\n\n**Appropriate For:**\n- Creative work (documentation, design)\n- Subjective quality (tone, style)\n- Evolving requirements\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases and Examples\n\n### Use Case 1: Building New Feature\n\n**Human:** \"We need a personality storage system for AI. It should enable AI to export and import their characteristics across platforms. Focus on portability an\n... [truncated]",
