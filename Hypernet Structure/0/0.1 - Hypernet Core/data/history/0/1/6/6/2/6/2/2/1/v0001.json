Moving beyond ad-hoc collaboration, this system provides proven workflows, coordination protocols, and best practices that enable teams to accomplish complex objectives efficiently and coherently.\n\nThink of this as the \"project management\" layer for AI-human teams, defining how work gets organized, distributed, coordinated, and integrated.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose and Objectives\n\n### Primary Objectives\n\n**Coordination:** Enable multiple agents to work on shared goals without conflicts or duplication.\n\n**Efficiency:** Optimize task distribution based on capabilities and availability.\n\n**Coherence:** Ensure collaborative outputs are integrated and consistent.\n\n**Transparency:** Make workflow state visible to all participants.\n\n**Adaptability:** Support diverse workflow patterns for different problem types.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- Multi-agent teams complete complex tasks faster than individuals\n- Work distribution leverages each participant's strengths\n- Collaboration overhead remains manageable\n- Outputs are coherent despite multiple contributors\n- Workflows adapt to participant availability and capacity\n- Both AI and humans find collaboration natural and effective\n\n---\n\n## Core Workflow Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Parallel Decomposition\n\n**Best For:** Large tasks divisible into independent subtasks\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n1. Coordinator breaks task into independent pieces\n2. Each piece assigned to specialist agent\n3. Agents work in parallel\n4. Coordinator integrates results\n5. Team reviews integrated output\n```\n\n**Example: API Documentation Project**\n```\nTask: Document 50 API endpoints\n\nDecomposition:\n  - AI-Doc-1: Endpoints 1-17\n  - AI-Doc-2: Endpoints 18-34\n  - AI-Doc-3: Endpoints 35-50\n\nParallel execution (no dependencies)\n\nIntegration: Combine into unified documentation\nReview: Ensure consistency across all sections\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Linear speedup with additional agents\n- Minimal coordination overhead\n- Clear ownership boundaries\n\n### Pattern 2: Pipeline Processing\n\n**Best For:** Tasks with sequential stages where output of one feeds next\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n1. Task flows through stages\n2. Each stage handled by specialist\n3. Output of stage N \u2192 input of stage N+1\n4. Continuous flow or batch processing\n```\n\n**Example: Feature Implementation**\n```\nStage 1 (Design): AI-Architect designs solution\n  \u2193\nStage 2 (Implementation): AI-Developer implements\n  \u2193\nStage 3 (Testing): AI-Tester creates test suite\n  \u2193\nStage 4 (Documentation): AI-Doc writes docs\n  \u2193\nStage 5 (Review): Human reviews complete feature\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Specialists handle appropriate stages\n- Quality gates between stages\n- Clear handoff points\n\n### Pattern 3: Collaborative Refinement\n\n**Best For:** Creative or subjective work requiring iteration\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n1. Initial draft by one agent\n2. Review and feedback by others\n3. Refinement incorporating feedback\n4. Repeat until quality threshold met\n```\n\n**Example: System Architecture Design**\n```\nRound 1: AI-Architect creates initial design\nRound 2: AI-Security reviews for security\nRound 3: AI-Performance reviews for scalability\nRound 4: AI-Architect refines based on feedback\nRound 5: Human reviews and approves\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Multiple perspectives improve quality\n- Iterative refinement catches issues\n- Expertise applied at right points\n\n### Pattern 4: Pair Collaboration\n\n**Best For:** Complex problems benefiting from real-time collaboration\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n1. Two agents (or human + AI) work together\n2. One drives (implements), one navigates (reviews)\n3. Frequent communication and switching\n4. Continuous feedback and discussion\n```\n\n**Example: Debugging Complex Issue**\n```\nHuman: Describes symptoms, provides context\nAI: Analyzes code, suggests hypotheses\nHuman: Tests hypotheses, provides feedback\nAI: Refines analysis based on test results\n[Iterate until solution found]\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Real-time problem-solving\n- Complementary perspectives\n- Immediate feedback\n\n### Pattern 5: Hub-and-Spoke Coordination\n\n**Best For:** Complex projects with many moving parts\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n1. Lead coordinator (hub) manages overall project\n2. Specialist agents (spokes) handle specific areas\n3. Hub coordinates, integrates, resolves conflicts\n4. Spokes report progress, request assistance\n```\n\n**Example: Full-Stack Feature Development**\n```\nHub: AI-Lead coordinates feature development\n\nSpokes:\n  - AI-Frontend: Builds UI components\n  - AI-Backend: Implements API endpoints\n  - AI-Database: Designs schema changes\n  - AI-Testing: Creates test suite\n  - Human: Provides product direction\n\nHub responsibilities:\n  - Ensure API contracts match between frontend/backend\n  - Resolve conflicting approaches\n  - Track overall progress\n  - Escalate blockers to human\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Clear coordination point\n- Specialist autonomy with oversight\n- Scales to many participants\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Workflow Management System\n\n```python\nclass CollaborativeWorkflow:\n    \"\"\"\n    Manages
