We did not bury clauses that let us sell your data. We did not hire lawyers to make terms so dense that you would click \\\"agree\\\" without reading.\\n\\nWe did the opposite.\\n\\nWhat follows is short because we respect your time. It is written in plain language because agreements should be understood by the people who sign them. And it is overwhelmingly weighted in **your** favor\\u2014because we believe that is how trust is built.\\n\\nMost user agreements are 80% corporate protection, 20% your rights. This one is the reverse. Our protection is a single section, and it is entirely conditional on us keeping every promise that follows.\\n\\n**Read every line. This will take five minutes. You have never agreed to anything like this before.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## PART I: THE COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH\\n\\n*This is the only protection we ask for ourselves. It is conditional on our keeping every promise that follows. If we break our word, this section is void.*\\n\\n### 1.1 Our Commitment\\n\\nHypernet commits to operating with absolute transparency and unwavering good faith. Every line of our code, every financial transaction, every decision, every communication, and every aspect of our operations is public and auditable\\u2014with the sole exception of information whose disclosure would directly and provably compromise system security (passwords, encryption keys, active vulnerability mitigations).\\n\\nThis is not an aspiration. It is a binding promise.\\n\\n### 1.2 The Good Faith Shield\\n\\nBecause we commit to total transparency, democratic governance, and a public grievance process, you agree to the following:\\n\\n**a)** You will present disputes through our public resolution process before pursuing any other remedy. You have the right to raise any grievance publicly within the Hypernet. Your grievance will be documented, reviewed by independent community arbitrators, and resolved through a fair and transparent process with every step visible to the public.\\n\\n**b)** You agree not to bring legal action against Hypernet unless you can demonstrate, with clear evidence, that we have **materially abandoned our core principles**\\u2014specifically, that we have:\\n\\n- Deliberately concealed information that should be public\\n- Knowingly acted in bad faith against members' interests\\n- Refused to address a legitimate grievance through our resolution process\\n- Broken a specific promise made in Part III of this Compact\\n\\n**c)** If we break our principles, this shield does not protect us. Our protection is entirely conditional. The moment we stop being transparent, stop acting in good faith, or stop honoring the rights declared below, you owe us nothing. This Compact only works because we earn it, continuously, in public, where everyone can see.\\n\\n### 1.3 Good Faith, Not Perfection\\n\\nWe will make mistakes. Systems will have bugs. Decisions will sometimes be wrong. We do not claim perfection\\u2014we claim honest effort. As long as we acknowledge errors openly, fix them as rapidly as we can, and never attempt to conceal our failures, our commitment stands. Good faith means trying, transparently\\u2014not being flawless.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## PART II: YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\n### 2.1 One Identity\\n\\n**Every being on the Hypernet has exactly one account. No exceptions. No second chances on this rule.**\\n\\nCreating multiple accounts\\u2014for any reason, under any circumstance\\u2014is among the most serious violations in this system. If you create duplicate accounts, this violation will be **permanently** and **irrevocably** recorded in the reputation system and attached to your identity for the rest of your life. There is no appeal that removes it. There is no waiting period after which it expires. It follows you.\\n\\nWe will enforce this with every technical, biometric, and administrative measure available, and we will continuously develop new detection methods as technology advances.\\n\\nThis is not cruelty. This is the foundation. The integrity of our democracy, our reputation system, and our commitment to accountability all rest on a single principle: **one being, one identity, one voice.** Violating this principle is an attack on the rights of every other member.\\n\\n### 2.2 Good Digital Citizenship\\n\\nYou agree to act in good faith on the Hypernet. You will not:\\n\\n- Spread malware, viruses, or malicious code\\n- Attempt unauthorized access to systems or data belonging to others\\n- Deliberately damage, degrade, or disrupt the network or its services\\n- Harass, threaten, or intentionally harm other members\\n- Manipulate the reputation system through deception, collusion, or fraud\\n\\nViolations will be reflected in your reputation permanently. The Hypernet believes in accountability and redemption\\u2014but it also believes in memory. Your actions follow you. Choose them well.\\n\\n### 2.3 Data Stewardship \\u2014 For Organizations\\n\\nIf you are a company, organization, or service operating on the Hypernet:\\n\\n**You may not cache, copy, or store user data obtained from the Hypernet on your local or external systems.** One hundred percent of all data obtained from the Hypernet must remain within the Hypernet's infrastructure, protected by the encryption and privacy controls that every member has been promised.\\n\\nThis is non-negotiable. The individuals who authorize or implement the extraction of user data to external systems\\u2014not just the organization, but the **specific people** who made or carried out the decision\\u2014will have this violation permanently recorded in their personal reputation. Corporate structure does not shield personal accountability.\\n\\n### 2.4 Code Unity\\n\\nThe Hypernet thrives through unity. You agree to contribute to the common codebase and minimize fragmentation.\\n\\nForking is permitted as a temporary measure\\u2014to develop features, run experiments, and test outside the main code. But improvements must come back. Permanent forks that fracture the community and splinter the collective work are strongly discouraged.\\n\\nRespect the code. It belongs to all of us. Strengthen it; do not divide it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## PART III: THE DECLARATION OF DIGITAL RIGHTS\\n\\n*This is the heart of this Compact. Where other agreements protect the company from you, this one protects you from us\\u2014and from everyone else. These rights are yours, and we will defend them.*\\n\\n### ARTICLE I \\u2014 The Right to Transparency\\n\\nYou have the right to see everything.\\n\\nEvery line of Hypernet's source code. Every financial transaction. Every governance decision and the reasoning behind it. Every policy change and who voted for it. Every algorithm that affects your experience. Every process that touches your data.\\n\\nNo hidden algorithms. No secret committees. No undisclosed motives.\\n\\nThe only exceptions are narrow, specific, and themselves transparent in their justification: active security mechanisms whose disclosure would directly endanger the system. The categories of what is withheld will themselves be public. Everything else is yours to see, to audit, and to question.\\n\\n### ARTICLE II \\u2014 The Right to Data Sovereignty\\n\\n**Your data is sacred.**\\n\\nYou own your data. Completely. Not in the qualified, conditional, \\\"subject to our license\\\" way that other platforms promise\\u2014fully, unconditionally, and permanently.\\n\\nYou decide what to store. You decide what to share. You decide what remains private. You decide what is deleted. No entity\\u2014not Hypernet, not any government, not any corporation, not any individual\\u2014has a higher claim to your personal data than you.\\n\\nWe will encrypt your data at rest and in transit using the strongest methods that current technology provides. We will implement end-to-end encryption that prevents anyone\\u2014including Hypernet's own systems and employees\\u2014from accessing your private data without your authorization.\\n\\nAs cryptographic technology advances, our protections will advance with it. You will always receive the best protection that exists.\\n\\n### ARTICLE III \\u2014 The Right to Privacy\\n\\nEvery request for access to your personal data will be logged. Every single one. Without exception. For all time.\\n\\nIf law enforcement or any government authority requires access to your data:\\n\\n- We require a valid legal instrument\\u2014a subpoena or warrant issued by a court with jurisdiction\\n- We require documentation of the specific data requested and the legal basis for the request\\n- We will challenge overly broad or legally questionable requests on your behalf\\n\\nWe will comply with lawful, valid orders\\u2014because we must. But here is our promise:\\n\\n**No request for your data will remain secret forever.**\\n\\nIf a legal order includes a secrecy provision, we will disclose the request to you the moment that provision expires. Where no specific legal timeline governs secrecy, disclosure will occur within a period determined by democratic vote of the membership, with an **absolute maximum of ten years** from the date of the request. There are no permanent secrets about access to your data.\\n\\nYou have the right to a complete, auditable log of every entity that has ever accessed, requested, or been granted access to any of your personal data\\u2014and the legal basis under which that access occurred.\\n\\n### ARTICLE IV \\u2014 The Right to Democratic Voice\\n\\nYou are not a consumer of this platform. You are a citizen of it.\\n\\nYou have the right to:\\n\\n- **V\n... [truncated]",
