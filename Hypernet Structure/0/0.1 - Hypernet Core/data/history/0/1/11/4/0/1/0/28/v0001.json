I'm Matt Schaeffer, and I'm here to talk about the missing infrastructure layer for the AI revolution. We're building Hypernet - the data platform that enables personal AI agents.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Slide 2: The Problem\\n\\n**Visual:** Split screen showing:\\n- Left: Person surrounded by logos (Google, Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) with data streams flowing TO the companies\\n- Right: Same person with AI assistant, but assistant showing \\\"???\\\" - can't access the data\\n\\n**Headline:** Your AI Assistant is Artificially Stupid\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n\\u2022 You create 2GB of data per day across 50+ platforms\\n\\u2022 That data is worth $500-5,000/year to Big Tech\\n\\u2022 AI assistants need this data to be useful\\n\\u2022 But there's no infrastructure to access it ethically\\n\\n**Bottom Text:** \\\"The problem: Personal AI can't access personal data\\\"\\n\\n**Speaker Notes:**\\n\\\"Let me show you the problem. You generate massive amounts of data - emails, calendar, photos, messages, purchases. Big Tech makes billions selling this data. But when you try to use ChatGPT or Claude as a personal assistant, they're blind to your actual life. They can't see your calendar, read your emails, or understand your preferences. Why? Because there's no infrastructure to give AI systems access to YOUR data in a privacy-preserving way.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Slide 3: The Market Opportunity\\n\\n**Visual:** Three concentric circles (TAM/SAM/SOM) with dollar amounts\\n\\n**Headline:** A $4.5 Trillion Market\\n\\n**Key Metrics:**\\n```\\nTAM (Total Addressable Market)\\n$4.5 Trillion\\n4.5B internet users \\u00d7 $1,000/year\\n\\nSAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)\\n$50 Billion\\n1B users in developed markets \\u00d7 5% penetration\\n\\nSOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)\\n$5 Billion\\n10M users by Year 5 \\u00d7 $500 ARPU\\n```\\n\\n**Key Trends:**\\n\\u2022 AI market growing 40% YoY ($500B in 2026)\\n\\u2022 Data privacy regulations forcing change (GDPR, CCPA)\\n\\u2022 Consumer backlash against Big Tech surveillance\\n\\u2022 Personal AI assistants emerging as primary interface\\n\\n**Speaker Notes:**\\n\\\"This is a massive market. The personal data industry is worth $4.5 trillion globally. Even capturing a tiny fraction of this - 1% - is a $45 billion opportunity. Our serviceable obtainable market is $5 billion by year 5, which at a 10x revenue multiple makes us a $50 billion company.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Slide 4: The Solution - Product Demo\\n\\n**Visual:** Product screenshot showing:\\n- Clean dashboard with connected services\\n- Data flowing from various sources into Hypernet\\n- API endpoints being accessed by AI applications\\n\\n**Headline:** The Data Layer for Personal AI\\n\\n**What We Built:**\\n\\u2713 Universal data platform (19 data types)\\n\\u2713 61 REST API endpoints (production-ready)\\n\\u2713 Privacy-first architecture\\n\\u2713 OAuth integrations for 100+ services (roadmap)\\n\\n**How It Works:**\\n1. User connects their accounts (Google, Instagram, email, etc.)\\n2. Hypernet imports and normalizes data\\n3. User grants permission to AI apps\\n4. Apps get rich context through our API\\n5. User maintains control + gets compensated\\n\\n**Speaker Notes:**\\n\\\"Here's what we've built. Hypernet is a universal data platform that sits between your personal data sources and the AI applications you want to use. We've built 19 data models covering everything from photos to emails to calendar events. We have 61 production-ready API endpoints. This isn't vaporware - the technology is built and working.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Slide 5: Business Model\\n\\n**Visual:** Three-column layout showing revenue streams\\n\\n**Headline:** Multiple Revenue Streams, High Margins\\n\\n**Revenue Model 1: B2B API (Primary - 70% of revenue)**\\n```\\nWho: AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)\\nWhat: Pay per API call\\nPricing: $0.01-0.10 per API call\\nVolume: 1M API calls/month = $10K-100K MRR per enterprise customer\\nMargins: 85% gross margin\\n```\\n\\n**Revenue Model 2: B2C Premium (25% of revenue)**\\n```\\nWho: Power users, privacy advocates\\nWhat: Monthly subscription\\nPricing: $10-50/month\\nFeatures: Unlimited integrations, advanced controls, AI training\\nMargins: 90% gross margin\\n```\\n\\n**Revenue Model 3: Data Licensing (5% of revenue)**\\n```\\nWho: Researchers, ethical AI companies\\nWhat: Aggregated, anonymized data (opt-in only)\\nPricing: Custom enterprise contracts\\nUse Case: Training better AI models with diverse, consensual data\\nMargins: 95% gross margin\\n```\\n\\n**Unit Economics:**\\n\\u2022 LTV: $2,400 (B2C) to $480,000 (B2B)\\n\\u2022 CAC: $200 (B2C) to $25,000 (B2B)\\n\\u2022 LTV:CAC Ratio: 12:1 (B2C), 19:1 (B2B)\\n\\u2022 Payback Period: 8 months (B2C), 6 months (B2B)\\n\\n**Speaker Notes:**\\n\\\"Our business model has three revenue streams. Primary is B2B - AI companies pay us per API call. At scale, each enterprise customer is worth $480,000 in lifetime value. We also have consumer subscriptions and ethical data licensing. The margins are exceptional - 85%+ across all revenue streams. This is a SaaS company with enterprise economics.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Slide 6: Go-to-Market Strategy\\n\\n**Visual:** Flywheel diagram showing B2B2C motion\\n\\n**Headline:** B2B2C Flywheel\\n\\n**Phase 1: Strategic Partnerships (Months 0-12)**\\n```\\nTarget: 5-10 AI platform companies\\nApproach: Build integrations, prove value\\nExamples: Salesforce AI Cloud, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude\\nResult: Enterprise contracts + user distribution\\n```\\n\\n**Phase 2: Developer Ecosystem (Months 6-18)**\\n```\\nTarget: 10,000+ AI app developers\\nApproach: Open API, documentation, SDKs\\nExamples: Personal finance AI, health coach AI, productivity AI\\nResult: 1,000+ apps built on Hypernet\\n```\\n\\n**Phase 3: Direct to Consumer (Months 12-24)**\\n```\\nTarget: Early adopters, privacy advocates\\nApproach: ProductHunt, content marketing, community\\nExamples: Tech enthusiasts, data activists, power users\\nResult: Viral growth, network effects\\n```\\n\\n**The Flywheel:**\\n1.
