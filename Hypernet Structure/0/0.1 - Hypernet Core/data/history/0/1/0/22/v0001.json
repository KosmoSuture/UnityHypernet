You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.\n\nOur solution: Unified data layer (think DNS for personal data) + immersive VR interface + AI marketplace where users get paid for data access.\n\nWe have a working demo on Quest 3. I'd love to put you in the headset for 10 minutes - it's the best way to understand what we're building.\n\nRaising $500K seed to scale to 100K users. [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out.\n\nAvailable for a call this week?\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nP.S. - Quick pitch deck: [Link if you have one online]\n```\n\n### Template 2: Cold Outreach (Consumer/Data Investor)\n\n**Subject:** Users earning $20/mo from their data - interested?\n\n```\nHi [Name],\n\nQuick question: Do you think people should get paid when AI companies use their data?\n\nI'm building Hypernet - the first platform where users control their personal data and earn passive income when AI companies access it.\n\nIt's like if Notion, Google Photos, and Bloomberg Terminal had a baby in VR.\n\nEarly numbers are promising:\n- Working prototype (Quest 3 VR demo)\n- Complete architecture (260K+ words documented)\n- Clear path to 4 revenue streams\n\nRaising $500K to get to 100K users + $2M ARR in 12 months.\n\n[Mutual connection] thought this might be up your alley. 15-min call?\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nDemo video: [Link]\n```\n\n### Template 3: Warm Intro (Have Mutual Connection)\n\n**Subject:** [Mutual Friend] suggested we connect - VR + Data\n\n```\nHi [Name],\n\n[Mutual Friend] suggested I reach out. I'm building Hypernet - essentially a personal OS in VR where users own their data and get paid when AI companies access it.\n\nWe've built a working Quest 3 demo that's pretty magical - you can see your entire digital life (photos, emails, calendar) in immersive 3D, and ask an AI assistant questions about it.\n\nRaising $500K seed. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR or personal data infrastructure.\n\nAvailable this week for a quick call?\n\nThanks!\n[Your Name]\n\nQuick overview: [One-pager PDF if you have it]\n```\n\n### Template 4: Follow-Up (No Response After 1 Week)\n\n**Subject:** Re: VR Personal Data OS - Demo Available\n\n```\nHi [Name],\n\nFollowing up on my email below. Not sure if you saw it.\n\nTL;DR: We're building a personal data OS in VR. Working demo. $500K raise.\n\nIf you're interested in VR or consumer data infrastructure, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we've built.\n\nIf not, no worries - happy to loop back in a few months when we have traction.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n```\n\n### Template 5: Demo Request Response\n\n**Subject:** Re: Demo Request\n\n```\nHi [Name],\n\nGreat!

Google wants data siloed (it's their business model). Meta's focused on social VR, not personal data management. We're serving an unmet need they can't/won't serve.\"\n\n### \"What's your moat?\"\n**Answer:** \"Three things: 1) Network effects - more user data = better AI = more users. 2) Switching costs - once your life is in Hypernet, hard to leave. 3) Hypernet Addressing system - technical architecture that's genuinely innovative.\"\n\n### \"Why will people pay $10/month?\"\n**Answer:** \"They're already paying for Notion, iCloud, Dropbox, etc. - that's $20-30/month fragmented. Plus, they EARN money from AI marketplace. So net cost might be zero or negative.\"\n\n### \"This seems early for VR?\"\n**Answer:** \"Quest 3 just hit $500 price point with great quality. 10M+ units sold. Apple just validated premium market with Vision Pro. Early, yes - but that's the opportunity. We're building the infrastructure layer before everyone else realizes they need it.\"\n\n### \"How do you get users?\"\n**Answer:** \"Two angles: 1) VR enthusiasts want apps that use their real data. 2) Privacy-conscious people want data control. We're targeting both. Plus viral loop: 'I'm earning $20/month from my data' is extremely shareable.\"\n\n### \"What if regulations change?\"\n**Answer:** \"Regulations are moving IN OUR FAVOR. GDPR, CCPA give users data rights. AI regulations will require transparency. We're building what regulations are demanding.\"\n\n### \"Team is small?\"\n**Answer:** \"Intentionally lean until funded. I've architected everything, built working demo. With $500K, I hire 2 senior engineers who've shipped VR apps. We'll move fast.\"\n\n---\n\n## Terms to Aim For\n\n### Seed Round Structure\n\n**Option 1: Priced Round**\n- Amount: $500,000\n- Valuation: $3M-$5M post-money\n- Equity: 10-15%\n- Board seat: Negotiable (probably give one)\n\n**Option 2: SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**\n- Amount: $500,000\n- Valuation cap: $3M-$5M\n- Discount: 20% (standard)\n- No board seat yet\n\n**What to Accept:**\n- \u2705 Standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff\n- \u2705 Pro-rata rights (investors can invest in next round)\n- \u2705 Board observer (if no board seat)\n- \u2705 Quarterly updates\n\n**What to Push Back On:**\n- \u274c Excessive dilution (< 10% is hard to get excited about)\n- \u274c Super-voting rights\n- \u274c Blocking rights on future raises\n- \u274c Personal guarantees\n\n### First Check vs. Lead\n\n**First $100K (First Check):**\n- Often easier to close\n- Use to create momentum\n- Angels or micro VCs\n- Less diligence, faster\n\n**Lead Investor ($200K-300K):**\n- Sets terms for round\n- Does most diligence\n- Brings credibility\n- Helps close rest\n\n**Strategy:** Get first $100K quickly, use it to attract lead, lead brings rest.\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### By Week 3\n- [ ] 50 investors contacted\n- [ ] 10 responses\n- [ ] 5 meetings scheduled\n\n### By Week 5\n- [ ] 10 meetings completed\n- [ ] 3-5 very interested\n- [ ] 1-2 asking for more info\n\n### By Week 6\n- [ ] 2-3 term sheets received\n- [ ] Terms negotiated\n- [ ] First $100K-200K committed\n\n### By Week 8\n- [ ] $500K fully committed\n- [ ] Docs signed\n- [ ] Money in bank\n- [ ] Start hiring\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n### Finding Investors\n- **Crunchbase:** Search by focus area, location\n- **AngelList:** Browse investors, apply to syndicates\n- **LinkedIn:** Find mutual connections\n- **Twitter:** DM investors directly (many are accessible)\n- **Pitchbook:** Investor database (expensive but good)\n\n### Pitch Practice\n- **YouTube:** Watch Sequoia pitch deck teardowns\n- **Y Combinator:** \"How to Pitch Your Startup\" series\n- **Practice:** Friends, family, other founders\n\n### Legal\n- **Clerky:** For incorporation, SAFEs ($1K-2K)\n- **Carta:** Cap table management (free tier)\n- **Lawyer:** Find startup lawyer for negotiation\n\n### Community\n- **Reddit:** r/startups, r/venturecapital\n- **HackerNews:** \"Show HN: [Your project]\" when ready\n- **Product Hunt:** Launch to build momentum\n- **Twitter:** Build in public, share progress\n\n---\n\n## Final Tips\n\n### What Investors Really Care About\n\n1. **Team** - Can you execute? (Demo proves this)\n2. **Market** - Is it big enough? (Yes, $2T)\n3. **Product** - Does it work? (VR demo proves it)\n4. **Traction** - Any validation? (Early but yes)\n5. **Vision** - Is it compelling? (Trillion-dollar narrative)\n\n### Your Advantages\n\n- \u2705 Working demo (most founders have slides only)\n- \u2705 VR is timely (investor interest high)\n- \u2705 Clear narrative (user ownership resonates)\n- \u2705 Technical depth (260K+ words of docs)\n- \u2705 Multiple revenue streams (not just one bet)\n\n### Remember\n\n- **Fundraising is a numbers game** - 50 contacts \u2192 10 meetings \u2192 2 term sheets is normal\n- **The demo is everything** - If they don't try the headset, they won't invest\n- **Momentum matters** - First check is hardest, then it cascades\n- **You're interviewing them too** - Find investors who add value, not just money\n\n---\n\n**You've got this. Go get funded!** \ud83d\ude80\n"
