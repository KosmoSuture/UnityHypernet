    "content": "# 1.2.1.2 - Archived Projects\n\n**Hypernet Address:** `1.2.1.2`\n**Owner:** Sarah Schaeffer (1.2)\n**Category:** Projects & Work - Archived\n**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis folder stores projects that were discontinued, cancelled, paused indefinitely, or are no longer relevant. These projects did not reach completion but may contain valuable information.\n\n---\n\n## What Goes Here\n\n### Project Types\n- **Cancelled Projects:** Projects that were stopped before completion\n- **Paused Projects:** Projects on indefinite hold\n- **Discontinued Ventures:** Business or personal ventures that ended\n- **Failed Experiments:** Ideas that didn't work out as planned\n- **Superseded Projects:** Projects replaced by newer approaches\n- **Inactive Projects:** No activity for extended period (6+ months)\n\n### Project Documentation\n\nEach archived project should include:\n- **Archive Reason:** Why the project was discontinued\n- **Archive Date:** When it was moved to archived status\n- **Project State:** What was completed before archiving\n- **Lessons Learned:** What was learned from the experience\n- **Salvageable Assets:** Useful materials for future projects\n- **Historical Context:** Why it seemed like a good idea at the time\n\n---\n\n## Examples of What Might Be Stored\n\n```\n1.2.1.2 - Archived Projects/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cancelled-Side-Project/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 archive-reason.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 work-completed.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 lessons-learned.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 salvageable-code/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Paused-Learning-Goal/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 progress-before-pause.md\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pause-reason.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 materials-gathered/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Discontinued-Hobby/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 what-was-tried.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 why-it-ended.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 photos-and-artifacts/\n```\n\n---\n\n## Privacy Considerations\n\n### Default Privacy Level\n- **Private:** Most archived projects are private\n- **Learning:** Some may be referenced for lessons learned\n- **Historical:** Kept for personal historical record\n\n### Data Sensitivity\n- May contain ideas that could be revisited\n- Failed business ideas should remain confidential\n- Personal projects may contain private interests\n- Some archived work may still be under NDA\n\n### Long-term Value\n- Archived projects teach valuable lessons\n- May inspire future similar projects\n- Document what doesn't work as well as what does\n- Preserve institutional knowledge\n\n---\n\n## Integration Sources\n\n### Potential Data Sources\n- **Project Management Tools:**\n  - Archived or deleted project boards\n  - Cancelled project exports\n  - Historical snapshots\n\n- **Version Control:**\n  - Abandoned repositories\n  - Unmerged branches\n  - Experimental code\n\n- **Documentation:**\n  - Draft documents never completed\n  - Planning materials for cancelled work\n  - Meeting notes from discontinued projects\n\n---\n\n## Lifecycle Management\n\n### Moving to Archived\nProjects move here from **1.2.1.0 - Active Projects** when:\n- Project is formally cancelled\n- No activity for 6+ months with no plans to resume\n- Project goals changed and original work is obsolete\n- Resources no longer available to continue\n- Priorities shifted and project deprioritized indefinitely\n\n### Potential Reactivation\nSome archived projects may eventually:\n- Be moved back to Active if revived\n- Inform new projects with similar goals\n- Provide materials for different projects\n- Teach lessons about what not to do\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Document Why:** Always record why project was archived\n2. **Capture Learnings:** Note what was learned from the experience\n3. **Save Useful Bits:** Preserve anything that might be valuable later\n4. **No Shame:** Failed projects are normal and educational\n5. **Be Honest:** Document what went wrong truthfully\n6. **Date It:** Record when and why it was archived\n7. **Extract Value:** Find the lessons in the discontinuation\n\n---\n\n## Learning from Archived Projects\n\nArchived projects provide:\n- **Lessons Learned:** What to avoid in future projects\n- **Idea Seeds:** Concepts that might work in different context\n- **Time Savers:** Don't repeat the same mistakes\n- **Realism:** Not every project succeeds, and that's okay\n- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify common failure points\n- **Honest Assessment:** What types of projects to avoid\n\n---\n\n## Related Sections\n\n- **1.2.1.0** - Active Projects (current work in progress)\n- **1.2.1.1** - Completed Projects (successfully finished work)\n- **1.2.9** - Notes & Knowledge (lessons learned documentation)\n\n---\n\n**Status:** Archive Directory\n**Linked Objects:** Projects, Lessons Learned, Historical Records\n**AI Access:** Valuable for learning project risk patterns\n",
