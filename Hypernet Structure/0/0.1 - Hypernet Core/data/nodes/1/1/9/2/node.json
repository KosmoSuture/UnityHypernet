Current\n5. \u2b1c Neural Networks Advanced (Week 5-6)\n6. \u2b1c Practical Advice for ML (Week 7)\n7. \u2b1c Support Vector Machines (Week 8)\n8. \u2b1c Unsupervised Learning (Week 9)\n9. \u2b1c Anomaly Detection (Week 10)\n10. \u2b1c Recommender Systems (Week 11)\n\n## Week 4 Notes: Neural Networks Basics\n\n### Key Concepts\n**Forward Propagation:**\n- Input layer \u2192 Hidden layers \u2192 Output layer\n- Each neuron computes: activation = sigmoid(weights * inputs + bias)\n- Matrix multiplication for efficient computation\n\n**Activation Functions:**\n- Sigmoid: \u03c3(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))\n- ReLU: max(0, z) - better for deep networks\n- Tanh: similar to sigmoid but [-1, 1] range\n\n**Vectorization:**\n```python\n# Instead of loops (slow):\nfor i in range(n):\n    z[i] = w[i] * x[i] + b[i]\n\n# Use vectorization (fast):\nz = np.dot(W, X) + b\n```\n\n### Practice Exercises Completed\n- \u2705 Exercise 1: Implement forward propagation\n- \u2705 Exercise 2: Vectorize neural network computation\n- \u2705 Exercise 3: Handwritten digit recognition (MNIST)\n  - Achieved 97.2% accuracy!\n\n### Project: Image Classification\nBuilt neural network to classify cat vs. dog images:\n- Training set: 1,000 images\n- Test accuracy: 89%\n- 3-layer network (784 \u2192 25 \u2192 10 \u2192 1)\n- Learning rate: 0.01\n- 500 iterations\n\nCode: `/learning-projects/ml-course/week4-cat-classifier/`\n\n### Key Insights\n- Vectorization makes HUGE difference in speed\n- ReLU activation works better than sigmoid for hidden layers\n- More hidden units = more complex patterns learned\n- Need to prevent overfitting (regularization)\n\n### Questions/Confusion\n- Why exactly does ReLU work better?\n- When to use different activation functions?\n- How to choose network architecture? (answered in Week 7)\n\n### Next Week\n- Backpropagation algorithm\n- Training neural networks\n- Gradient descent variants\n\n## Overall Progress\n- Time per week: 4-6 hours\n- Feeling: Challenging but rewarding\n- Confidence: Growing, concepts clicking\n- Application: Already using in HyperTask project\n\n## Resources\n- Course videos (Coursera)\n- Programming assignments (Jupyter notebooks)\n- Supplementary readings\n- Online ML community (r/MachineLearning)\n- Study group: Weekly Zoom calls\n\n## Goals\n- \u2705 Complete course by March 1, 2026\n- Apply ML to HyperTask AI features\n- Build portfolio ML project\n- Get certified\n- Continue to Advanced ML courses\n```\n\n### Book Notes Example\n```markdown\n# Atomic Habits by James Clear\n\n**Author:** James Clear\n**Started:** January 15, 2026\n**Finished:** February 8, 2026\n**Pages:** 320\n**Rating:** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5/5)\n\n## Summary\nComprehensive guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones using a science-based framework. Core idea: tiny changes compound into remarkable results.\n\n## The 4 Laws of Behavior Change\n\n### 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n- **Implementation intentions:** \"I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]\"\n- **Habit stacking:** After [current habit], I will [new habit]\n- **Environment design:** Make cues visible\n- **Eliminate bad habit cues:** Make them invisible\n\n### 2nd Law: Make It Attractive\n- **Temptation bundling:** Pair desired action with needed one\n- **Join a culture:** Where desired behavior is normal\n- **Motivation ritual:** Do something you enjoy before difficult habit\n\n### 3rd Law: Make It Easy\n- **2-minute rule:** New habits should take less than 2 minutes\n- **Reduce friction:** Decrease steps for good habits\n- **Prime environment:** Prepare for success\n- **Automate:** Use technology to lock in good behavior\n\n### 4th Law: Make It Satisfying\n- **Immediate reward:** Give yourself immediate pleasure\n- **Habit tracking:** Visual measure of progress (don't break the chain)\n- **Never miss twice:** If you miss one day, get back next day\n- **Accountability partner:** Someone to answer to\n\n## Key Quotes\n> \"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\"\n\n> \"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\"\n\n> \"The most effective way to change your behavior is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\"\n\n> \"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.\"\n\n## Practical Applications for Me\n\n### Habits to Build\n1. **Morning exercise:** After I pour coffee, I will do 10 push-ups\n2. **Daily writing:** After I sit at desk, I will write for 2 minutes\n3. **Reading:** After I brush teeth at night, I will read 2 pages\n4. **Meditation:** After I wake up, I will meditate for 2 minutes\n\n### Environment Design\n- Put gym clothes next to bed (workout cue)\n- Put phone in other room at night (reduce distraction)\n- Pre-pack gym bag night before\n- Put book on pillow (reading cue)\n\n### Habit Tracking\n- Created habit tracker in HyperTask\n- Marking X for each day completed\n- Visual motivation seeing streak\n\n## Chapter-by-Chapter Notes\n\n### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\n- 1% better every day = 37x better in a year\n- Breakthrough moments are often result of many small actions\n- Focus on systems, not goals\n\n[... detailed notes for each chapter ...]\n\n## Action Items\n- [x] Create habit tracker\n- [x] Design environment for success\n- [x] Implement 2-minute versions of desired habits\n- [x] Set up habit stacking\n- [ ] Review this every month\n- [ ] Share key concepts with team\n\n## Related Books to Read\n- \"The Power of Habit\" by Charles Duhigg\n- \"Tiny Habits\" by BJ Fogg\n- \"Deep Work\" by Cal Newport\n- \"Essentialism\" by Greg McKeown\n\n## Impact\nChanged how I think about behavior change. Already implementing habit stacking and 2-minute rule. Seeing results with consistency.
