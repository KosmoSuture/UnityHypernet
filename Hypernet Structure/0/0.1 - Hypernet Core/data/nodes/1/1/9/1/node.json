Vector databases enable similarity search on embeddings. Need to evaluate options.\n\n## Methodology\n1. Literature review of vector database options\n2. Technical documentation review\n3. Proof-of-concept implementations\n4. Performance benchmarking\n5. Cost analysis\n6. Developer experience evaluation\n\n## Options Being Evaluated\n1. **Pinecone**\n   - Fully managed\n   - Easy to use\n   - Cost: $70/month minimum\n   - Performance: Excellent\n   - Integration: Simple API\n\n2. **Weaviate**\n   - Open source option\n   - Self-hosted or cloud\n   - Cost: Self-hosting $20/month\n   - Performance: Very good\n   - Integration: More complex\n\n3. **Qdrant**\n   - Open source\n   - Rust-based (fast)\n   - Cost: Free self-hosted\n   - Performance: Excellent\n   - Integration: Good API\n\n4. **pgvector (PostgreSQL extension)**\n   - Uses existing PostgreSQL\n   - Cost: $0 (already using Postgres)\n   - Performance: Good for small scale\n   - Integration: Seamless with current DB\n\n## Research Sources\n- [x] Official documentation (all 4)\n- [x] Hacker News discussions\n- [x] Reddit r/MachineLearning threads\n- [x] Blog posts from practitioners\n- [x] YouTube comparison videos\n- [x] Academic papers on vector search\n- [ ] Conduct user interviews\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Performance\n- All options handle <1M vectors well\n- Pinecone and Qdrant fastest for large scale\n- pgvector sufficient for current needs\n\n### Cost\n- pgvector: $0 (existing infrastructure)\n- Self-hosted Qdrant: ~$20/month\n- Pinecone: $70/month minimum\n- Weaviate cloud: $50/month\n\n### Developer Experience\n- Pinecone: Easiest, best docs\n- pgvector: Familiar (SQL)\n- Qdrant: Good API, good docs\n- Weaviate: Steeper learning curve\n\n## Proof of Concept Results\nBuilt POC with pgvector:\n- Successfully implemented\n- Query time: ~50ms average\n- Accuracy: 92% (good enough)\n- Integration: Smooth\n- Cost: $0\n\n## Conclusion\n**Recommendation: Start with pgvector**\n\nReasoning:\n1. Zero additional cost\n2. Sufficient performance for current scale\n3. Easy integration (existing Postgres)\n4. Can migrate to dedicated vector DB later if needed\n5. Reduces complexity\n\nDecision: Implement with pgvector, monitor performance, migrate if/when we hit scale issues.\n\n## Next Steps\n- [ ] Implement pgvector in production\n- [ ] Set up performance monitoring\n- [ ] Define migration triggers\n- [ ] Document implementation\n\n## References\n- [pgvector GitHub](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)\n- [Pinecone vs Alternatives](https://blog.example.com/...)\n- [Vector Database Comparison Paper](https://arxiv.org/...)\n\n## Date Completed\nFebruary 8, 2026\n\n## Outcome\nImplemented pgvector, working great so far. Will revisit when we hit 1M+ vectors.\n```\n\n### Market Research Example\n```markdown\n# Market Research: Task Management App Market 2026\n\n**Research Period:** December 2025 - January 2026\n**Purpose:** Understand competitive landscape for HyperTask positioning\n\n## Research Questions\n1.
