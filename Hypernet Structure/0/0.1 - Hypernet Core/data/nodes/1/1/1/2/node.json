    "content": "# 1.1.1.2 - Archived Projects\n\n**Hypernet Address:** `1.1.1.2`\n**Owner:** Matt Schaeffer (1.1)\n**Category:** Projects & Work - Archived\n**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis folder stores projects that were paused, cancelled, or abandoned. These projects didn't reach completion but contain valuable information, lessons, and context that may be useful in the future.\n\n---\n\n## What Goes Here\n\n### Project Types\n- **Paused Projects:** On hold indefinitely, may resume someday\n- **Cancelled Projects:** Deliberately stopped before completion\n- **Abandoned Projects:** Gradually stopped without formal closure\n- **Failed Ventures:** Projects that didn't achieve their goals\n- **Pivoted Projects:** Projects that evolved into something else\n- **Deprioritized Work:** Projects postponed for more important work\n- **Experimental Projects:** Tests or proofs-of-concept that concluded\n- **Sunset Projects:** Projects that served their purpose and were retired\n\n### Project Documentation\n\nEach archived project should include:\n- **Archive Reason:** Why the project was stopped or paused\n- **Final State:** Where things were left off\n- **Key Learnings:** What was discovered or learned\n- **Obstacles Encountered:** What prevented completion\n- **Salvageable Assets:** Code, designs, or ideas worth keeping\n- **Decision Documentation:** Why cancellation/pause was decided\n- **Historical Context:** Background and original motivation\n- **Potential for Revival:** Conditions under which it might resume\n\n---\n\n## Examples of What Might Be Stored\n\n```\n1.1.1.2 -

Cancelled Asana/Trello boards\n  - Closed-without-completion Jira projects\n  - Abandoned Notion databases\n\n- **Version Control:**\n  - GitHub repositories (incomplete branches)\n  - Abandoned forks\n  - Experimental branches\n\n- **Communication Archives:**\n  - Slack channels for cancelled projects\n  - Email threads about project cancellation\n  - Final status updates\n\n- **Planning Documents:**\n  - Draft business plans\n  - Incomplete specifications\n  - Abandoned roadmaps\n\n- **Financial Records:**\n  - Investment that wasn't recovered\n  - Sunk costs documentation\n  - Write-off records\n\n### Automation Opportunities\n- Auto-archive projects with no activity for 6+ months\n- Flag projects for review when stale\n- Summarize lessons from archived projects\n- Extract reusable components\n- Pattern detection across failed projects\n\n---\n\n## Lifecycle Management\n\n### Moving to Archived\nProjects move here from **1.1.1.0 - Active Projects** when:\n- Formally cancelled or paused\n- No activity for extended period (6+ months)\n- Resources reallocated to other priorities\n- Obstacles prevent continuation\n- Goals no longer relevant\n- Team disbanded or unavailable\n\n### Potential for Revival\nSome archived projects may be:\n- **Revived:** Moved back to Active if circumstances change\n- **Referenced:** Used as inspiration for new projects\n- **Mined:** Components extracted for other projects\n- **Studied:** Analyzed to avoid repeating mistakes\n\n### Permanent Deletion\nConsider deleting archived projects only when:\n- Zero potential for future value\n- Storage space is critical\n- Legal/compliance requires removal\n- After 10+ years with no reference\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Document Why:** Always record reason for archiving\n2. **Be Honest:** Write truthful reasons for failure/pause\n3. **Extract Lessons:** What did you learn?\n4. **Save Assets:** Keep reusable code, designs, research\n5. **No Shame:** Archived projects are learning opportunities\n6. **Regular Review:** Annually review archived projects\n7. **Consider Revival:** Some ideas just need better timing\n8. **Preserve Context:** Future you will appreciate details\n\n---\n\n## Value of Archived Projects\n\n### Learning Value\n- **Failure Analysis:** Understand what went wrong\n- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring problems\n- **Risk Assessment:** Learn what risks to avoid\n- **Better Planning:** Inform future project planning\n- **Resource Estimation:** Learn about time/cost realities\n\n### Asset Recovery\n- **Reusable Code:** Extract useful functions or modules\n- **Design Elements:** Salvage good design concepts\n- **Research Data:** Market research remains valuable\n- **Network Contacts:** Relationships built during project\n- **Documentation:** Specs or docs useful elsewhere\n\n### Personal Growth\n- **Humility:** Remind yourself that failure is normal\n- **Persistence:** See how many attempts lead to success\n- **Evolution:** Track how your skills have improved\n- **Judgment:** Understand how your priorities shifted\n- **Wisdom:** Accumulated knowledge from experience\n\n---\n\n## Related Sections\n\n- **1.1.1.0** - Active Projects (current work)\n- **1.1.1.1** - Completed Projects (successful completions)\n- **1.1.9.1** - Research (learnings from archived projects)\n- **1.1.9.7** - Ideas & Creativity (project ideas to revive)\n- **1.1.7** - Contributions (salvaged outputs)\n\n---\n\n**Status:** Archive Directory\n**Linked Objects:** Projects, Lessons, Assets, Historical Context\n**AI Access:** Valuable for learning from failures and patterns\n",
