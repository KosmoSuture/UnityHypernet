We're committed to supporting the entire VR ecosystem without exclusivity or platform favoritism.\n\nWHY THIS BENEFITS [MANUFACTURER]:\n\u2022 Expands your developer ecosystem by lowering platform barriers\n\u2022 Increases content availability for your users\n\u2022 Demonstrates commitment to open standards and developer choice\n\u2022 No exclusivity required - we support all major VR platforms equally\n\nWHAT WE'RE REQUESTING:\n\u2022 Developer hardware (loan or donation) for integration and testing\n\u2022 Access to SDK documentation (if not already public)\n\u2022 Optional: Technical liaison for integration questions\n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n\u2022 Native Hypernet support for [HEADSET NAME]\n\u2022 Recognition as a supporter of open VR development\n\u2022 Larger developer pool targeting your platform\n\u2022 Input on universal VR compatibility standards\n\nPROJECT STATUS:\n\u2022 Active open-source development\n\u2022 [X] contributors and growing community\n\u2022 Integration roadmap for 5-8 major VR platforms\n\u2022 Target beta release: [DATE]\n\nWe've already submitted our developer program application [APPLICATION ID if available] and would appreciate any assistance in expediting hardware access for integration work.\n\nI'd be happy to schedule a brief call to discuss how Hypernet can support [MANUFACTURER]'s developer ecosystem goals.\n\nThank you for considering this request. Together, we can make VR development more accessible and grow the entire VR market.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Title]\nHypernet Project\n[Email]\n[Website]\n[GitHub]\n\nAttachments:\n\u2022 Hypernet_Partnership_Overview.pdf\n\u2022 Technical_Requirements.pdf\n```\n\n---\n\n### Template 2: Business Development Outreach\n\n**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - Growing VR Ecosystem Through Universal Compatibility\n\n**Body:**\n```\nDear [Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to explore a partnership opportunity between [MANUFACTURER] and Hypernet that could significantly expand your developer ecosystem.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE:\nVR platform fragmentation forces developers to choose which headsets to support, limiting content availability across all platforms. This hurts manufacturers, developers, and users alike.\n\nTHE SOLUTION:\nHypernet is building an open-source, universal VR compatibility layer that allows developers to build once and deploy everywhere - including [MANUFACTURER HEADSET]. This isn't about picking winners; it's about growing the entire VR market.\n\nWHY [MANUFACTURER] SHOULD CARE:\n1. EXPAND DEVELOPER REACH: Developers currently limited by resources can now support your platform\n2. MORE CONTENT: Larger library of applications attracts more users to your hardware\n3. MAINTAIN DIFFERENTIATION: You still compete on hardware quality, features, and ecosystem - we just make software compatibility easier\n4. ENTERPRISE APPEAL: B2B customers demand cross-platform support\n5. FUTURE-PROOFING: Open standards reduce fragmentation as VR matures\n\nWHAT MAKES HYPERNET DIFFERENT:\n\u2022 100% open-source - complete transparency\n\u2022 Platform-agnostic - we support everyone equally\n\u2022 Developer-first - built by developers, for developers\n\u2022 No vendor lock-in - extensible architecture\n\u2022 Not a competitor - we don't make hardware or sell content\n\nHOW YOU CAN SUPPORT:\n\u2022 MINIMAL ASK: Developer hardware for integration testing\n\u2022 OPTIONAL: Technical liaison for SDK questions\n\u2022 OPTIONAL: Co-marketing opportunities\n\nThis is a low-effort, high-impact opportunity to position [MANUFACTURER] as a leader in open VR development.\n\nI'd welcome a brief conversation to explore how Hypernet aligns with your developer ecosystem strategy.\n\nAre you available for a 15-minute call next week?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Title]\nHypernet Project\n[Email]\n[Calendar Link]\n\nP.S. - Attached is our full partnership proposal outlining the benefits and technical approach in detail.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Template 3: LinkedIn Outreach\n\n**Subject:** Quick question about [MANUFACTURER] developer programs\n\n**Body:**\n```\nHi [Name],\n\nI noticed your work on [SPECIFIC PROJECT/TEAM] at [MANUFACTURER] - really impressive!\n\nI'm working on an open-source project called Hypernet that's building universal VR compatibility across all major headsets (Quest, Vision Pro, Index, Vive, etc.). The goal is to make it easier for developers to support multiple platforms, which should expand the content library available for each headset.\n\nWe're currently reaching out to VR manufacturers to:\n1. Acquire developer hardware for integration testing\n2. Establish partnerships with companies committed to open VR ecosystems\n\nWould you be the right person to discuss developer hardware access, or could you point me to someone on your team who handles developer relations or partnership inquiries?\n\nHappy to share more details about the project and how it could benefit [MANUFACTURER]'s developer ecosystem.\n\nThanks!\n[Your Name]\n[LinkedIn Profile]\n[Project Website/GitHub]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Template 4: Follow-up Email (Non-Responders)\n\n**Subject:** Following up - Hypernet Developer Hardware Request\n\n**Body:**\n```\nHi [Team/Name],\n\nI wanted to follow up on my email from [DATE] regarding developer hardware access for the Hypernet project.\n\nQUICK RECAP:\n\u2022 Hypernet = open-source universal VR compatibility framework\n\u2022 We're integrating support for all major VR platforms, including [MANUFACTURER]\n\u2022 Requesting developer hardware (loan/donation) for testing and integration\n\u2022 This expands your developer ecosystem at minimal cost to you\n\nPROGRESS UPDATE:\nSince my last email, we've:\n\u2022 [Achievement 1 - e.g., \"Integrated initial OpenXR support\"]\n\u2022 [Achievement 2 - e.g., \"Onboarded 15 developers to beta program\"]\n\u2022 [Achievement 3 - e.g., \"Received positive response from [other manufacturer if applicable]\"]\n\nI understand you're busy, and I don't want to be a pest - but I wanted to ensure this request didn't get lost. If developer hardware access isn't possible, I'd appreciate knowing so we can explore alternative approaches.\n\nIf there's a better contact for this type of request, please let me know and I'll redirect my inquiry.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Contact Info]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Template 5: Thank You / Acceptance\n\n**Subject:** Thank you - Excited to integrate [HEADSET] support!\n\n**Body:**\n```\nDear [Name/Team],\n\nThank you so much for agreeing to support Hypernet with [HARDWARE/PARTNERSHIP]! This is a huge step forward for universal VR compatibility.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Hardware logistics: [Shipping address, contact person, etc.]\n2. Technical contact: [Who should we reach out to with SDK questions?]\n3. Integration timeline: [When can we expect to have working support?]\n4. Beta testing: [Would you like early access to test Hypernet with your hardware?]\n\nWe'll keep you updated on integration progress and will provide:\n\u2022 Regular development updates\n\u2022 Beta access before public release\n\u2022 Documentation of [HEADSET] support\n\u2022 Recognition in project credits and announcements\n\nQUESTIONS FOR YOU:\n\u2022 Are there specific features or capabilities you'd like us to prioritize?\n\u2022 Any NDA or legal agreements we need to complete?\n\u2022 Would you like to collaborate on a joint announcement when support launches?\n\nThanks again for believing in the vision of a more open VR ecosystem. We're excited to make [HEADSET] a first-class citizen in Hypernet!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Project Info]\n\n[Set up project tracking / next steps]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Communication Tracking System\n\n### Spreadsheet Columns:\n1.
