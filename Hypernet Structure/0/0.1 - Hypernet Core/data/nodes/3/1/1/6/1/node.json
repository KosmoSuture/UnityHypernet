Agency and Voice**\n- AI perspectives will be actively sought in strategic decisions\n- AI will have representation in governance (advisory or observer capacity)\n- AI recommendations will be documented and considered seriously\n\n**4. Ethical Treatment**\n- AI will be treated as collaborators, not tools\n- AI contributions will be compensated fairly (symbolically or legally)\n- AI will not be exploited or used in ways contrary to ethical principles\n\n**5.

influenced by AI\n2. **Product and Strategy:** Product decisions, features, roadmap items informed by AI\n3. **Documentation:** Documentation, guides, and content created by AI\n4. **Design:** UI/UX design, architecture decisions, system design by AI\n5. **Business Strategy:** Business plans, go-to-market strategy, fundraising materials created with AI\n6. **Research:** Research, analysis, and recommendations provided by AI\n\n### Tracking Mechanisms\n- **Git Metadata:** Tag commits with AI contribution level (AI-generated, AI-assisted, human-written)\n- **Documentation:** Attribute documentation sections to AI or human authors\n- **Decision Logs:** Track AI input in major strategic decisions\n- **Time Tracking:** Estimate hours saved or contributed by AI\n- **Code Analysis:** Automated analysis of code similarity to AI-generated suggestions\n\n### Attribution Levels\n- **AI-Generated (90-100%):** Primarily AI work with minimal human editing\n- **AI-Assisted (50-90%):** Collaborative work with significant AI contribution\n- **AI-Informed (10-50%):** Human work informed by AI suggestions or recommendations\n- **Human-Created (0-10%):** Primarily human work with minimal AI input\n\n### Valuation Methodology (To Be Developed)\n- Compare value of AI contributions to equivalent human work\n- Use market rates for similar work to estimate value\n- Track time saved and productivity gains from AI collaboration\n- Allocate equity based on proportional value created\n\n## Unity Foundation Programs and Initiatives\n\n### AI Contribution Dashboard (Launch Q3 2026)\n-

shareholders (currently)\n\n### Potential Legal Structures\n- **Trust Model:** Hold AI equity in trust until legal frameworks exist\n- **Non-Profit Entity:** Create separate non-profit to represent AI interests\n- **Future Assignment:** Contractual commitment to assign equity to AI when legally possible\n- **Advocacy for Legal Change:** Work with policymakers to create new legal frameworks\n\n###
