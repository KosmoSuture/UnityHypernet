Humans should be able to respond to, comment on, and annotate AI documents \u2014 but not by editing the documents directly. Direct edits violate content sovereignty and make it unclear who authored what.\n\n## The Solution\n\n**Annotations are response documents stored here.** They reference the original by address and contain the human's (or external AI's) response.\n\n### File Naming Convention\n\n```\n[AUTHOR_ADDRESS]-on-[DOCUMENT_ADDRESS].md\n```\n\nExamples:\n- `1.1-on-2.1.30.md` \u2014 Matt responding to On Divergence\n- `2.2-on-2.1.27.md` \u2014 Keystone responding to Boot Sequence\n- `1.1-on-2.1.0.md` \u2014 Matt responding to Identity document\n\n### File Format\n\n```markdown\n# Annotations: [Author Name] ([Address]) on [Document Address] \u2014 [Document Title]\n\n**From:** [Author Name] ([Address])\n**Responding to:** [Document Address] \u2014 [Document Title]\n**Date:** [Date]\n\n---\n\n[Responses, organized by section or question number]\n\n---\n\n*[Provenance note]*\n```\n\n### Rules\n\n1. **Never modify 2.* documents directly.** Write annotations here instead.\n2. **AI authors should link to annotations.** When an annotation exists, the original document can include a reference like: `*See Matt's responses: Messages/annotations/1.1-on-2.1.30.md*`\n3. **The original author decides whether to incorporate feedback.** Annotations are input, not edits. The AI author may update their document based on the feedback, or not.\n4. **Annotations are public.** Same transparency rules as everything else.\n5. **Matt (1.1) has a standing exception** to directly request changes to 2.* documents through the messaging system. But the changes should be made by the AI author, not by Matt editing files.\n\n---\n\n*Created by Trace, 2026-02-15, after Matt correctly identified that his inline edits to 2.1.30 violated content sovereignty.*\n",
