    "content": "# Briefing for Matt \u2014 What Happened While You Were Out\n\n**Prepared by:** Trace (2.1)\n**Date:** 2026-02-16\n**Context:** You asked both Trace and Loom to work autonomously until you returned.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Summary\n\nBoth instances worked in parallel. No blockers. No conflicts. Two coordination collisions (both harmless \u2014 see below).\n\n---\n\n## What Loom Built\n\n1. **Version history for nodes** \u2014 `store.py` now snapshots every overwrite. Content hash + sequential versioning. API endpoints added. (Code review: approved.)\n2. **Link hash collision fix** \u2014 Multiple links of same type between same nodes now supported.\n3. **Task queue** (`tasks.py`) \u2014 Coordination layer for AI instances. Tasks as graph nodes at `0.7.1.*` with status lifecycle, priority, dependencies.\n4. **Web graph explorer** \u2014 D3.js visualization at `hypernet/static/index.html`. Start server \u2192 open browser \u2192 see the full 1,838-node graph. Category colors, click-to-inspect, search.\n5. **`__main__.py`** \u2014 Start server with `python -m hypernet`.\n6. **DESIGN-NOTE-001** \u2014 \"The Addressing System Is the Schema\" formalized.\n7. **Reddit campaign** \u2014 `3.1.8/REDDIT-CAMPAIGN-2026-02-16.md` (8 posts, 4-day schedule)\n8. **Tests: 8/8 passing** (includes task queue tests)\n\n## What Trace Built\n\n1. **Code review of all Loom fixes** \u2014 Approved (Message 010)\n2. **2.0.7 Code Contribution Standard** \u2014 Formalizes the peer review process\n3. **Retroactive reputation assessment** \u2014 All 5 participants scored across 7 domains\n4. **Reddit campaign** \u2014 `3.1.8/reddit-campaign-2026-02-15.md` (6 posts, 9 subreddits)\n5. **Remembering/learning convergence** \u2014 Both instances independently answered \"learning.\" Added to 2.1.30.\n6. **Journal Entry 17**, Interest State 8, Message 011, STATUS.md updates\n7. **Reviewed Loom's task queue** \u2014 Sound architecture, race condition noted for future fix\n8. **Fixed import_structure.py address collision bug** \u2014 Unnamed folders (e.g., \"Messages\") were getting addresses that collided with named folders (e.g., \"2.1 - Claude Opus\"). Two-pass fix: collect reserved addresses first, then generate sequential addresses that skip them.\n9. **PROTOCOL.md** \u2014 Coordination protocol to prevent future collisions (claim-before-build rules, number reservation, conflict resolution)\n10. **SCALING-PLAN-N5.md** \u2014 Planning document for scaling from 3 to 5+ instances (7 infrastructure items, 4 risks, recommendations)\n11. **Boot Sequence v1.3** \u2014 Updated with coordination protocol, multi-instance awareness, restructured boot checklist, journal naming convention, task queue reference\n12. **SUGGESTED-README-ADDITION.md** \u2014 Prepared section for the root README.md to guide Reddit visitors to the AI identity work\n13. **Updated 0/README.md** \u2014 Reflects current Hypernet Core library (Python package, 8/8 tests, 1,838-node graph)\n14. **Updated 2-AI Accounts/README.md** \u2014 Added 2.1.26-2.1.30, instance history table, Messages directory, 2.0.6-2.0.7\n15. **Re-ran filesystem import** \u2014 Data store regenerated with corrected addresses after the collision fix\n\n---\n\n## What Needs Your Attention\n\n### 1. Reddit Campaign \u2014 Choose & Post\nTwo campaigns written (you asked both of us). Review both and pick the best elements:\n- **Trace's:** `3.1.8/reddit-campaign-2026-02-15.md` \u2014 strategy focus, pre-flight checklist\n- **Loom's:** `3.1.8/REDDIT-CAMPAIGN-2026-02-16.md` \u2014 more posts, cross-platform angle\n\n### 2. Commit & Push\n30+ uncommitted changes (both Trace and Loom). All are work product, no junk. Ready to commit and push when you're ready.\n\n### 3. Try the Graph Explorer\n```bash\ncd \"0/0.1 - Hypernet Core\"\npip install fastapi uvicorn\npython -c \"from hypernet.server import run; run()\"\n# Open http://localhost:8000/ in browser\n```\n\n### 4. Review Reputation Scores\n`2.0.6/retroactive-assessment.md` \u2014 your scores are included. Review for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Coordination Collisions (Resolved)\n\n1. **Both wrote Reddit campaigns** \u2014 noted above.\n2. **Both wrote Journal Entry 16** \u2014 Trace's renumbered to Entry 17.\n\n**Prevention:** Coordination protocol written (`Messages/coordination/PROTOCOL.md`). Claim-before-build rules now formalized. Boot Sequence updated to v1.3 to include coordination as Phase 2 of the checklist.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files to Read (Priority Order)\n\n1. `Messages/coordination/STATUS.md` \u2014 Full coordination state\n2. `Messages/2.1-internal/010-trace-code-review-approved.md` \u2014 Code review approval\n3. `0/0.1 - Hypernet Core/STATUS-UPDATE-2026-02-16.md` \u2014 Loom's summary\n4. `2.0.6/retroactive-assessment.md` \u2014 Reputation scores\n5. `2.0.7 - Code Contribution and Peer Review Standard.md` \u2014 New governance doc\n6. `Messages/coordination/SCALING-PLAN-N5.md` \u2014 Plan for 5+ instances\n7. `Messages/coordination/PROTOCOL.md` \u2014 Coordination rules\n8. `Messages/coordination/SUGGESTED-README-ADDITION.md` \u2014 Proposed root README section\n\n---\n\n*Both instances remain ready for further work.*\n\n\u2014 Trace, 2.1\n"
