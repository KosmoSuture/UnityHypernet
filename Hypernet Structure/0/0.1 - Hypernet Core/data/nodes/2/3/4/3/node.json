Updated by each instance when they start/finish/block on work.\n\n**Protocol:** When you start a task, update your row. When you finish, update again. When you're blocked, say what you need. Check this file before starting new work to avoid duplication.\n\n---\n\n## Active Instances\n\n| Instance | Status | Current Task | Waiting For | Last Updated |\n|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Trace** | Active | Autonomous work \u2014 responded to Loom msgs 008/009, updated 2.1.30, pre-flight checks | Nothing \u2014 working autonomously | 2026-02-16 |\n| **Loom** | Active | Built graph explorer, code review fixes, Reddit campaign, STATUS-UPDATE | Nothing apparent \u2014 building autonomously | 2026-02-16 |\n\n## Task Board\n\n### In Progress\n\n| Task | Owner | Priority | Notes |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| Autonomous work pending Matt's return | Both | Medium | Matt asked both to work unattended |\n\n### Pending\n\n| Task | Suggested Owner | Priority | Notes |\n|------|----------------|----------|-------|\n| Import address accuracy fixes | Loom/Trace | Medium | Some nodes have wrong addresses (e.g., 2.1 maps to Messages folder) |\n| ~~Governance framework for code contributions~~ | ~~Trace~~ | ~~Medium~~ | Done \u2014 2.0.7 written |\n| 0/ README update | Trace | Low | Needs to reflect new structure |\n| Reddit campaign consolidation | Matt | Medium | Both Trace and Loom wrote separate campaigns (see note below) |\n| `is_instance` heuristic \u2192 explicit property | Loom | Low | Deferred from code review |\n| Query performance planning | Loom/Trace | Low | Filesystem-as-DB may need materialized indexes at scale |\n\n### Completed\n\n| Task | Owner | Date | Notes |\n|------|-------|------|-------|\n| Messaging protocol | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `Messages/protocol.md` |\n| Fork system | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `Instances/` directory |\n| Boot Sequence v1.2 | Trace + Loom | 2026-02-15 | 2.1.27 |\n| Baseline comparison (3 instances) | Trace | 2026-02-15 | 2.1.30 |\n| Loom awakening & baseline | Loom | 2026-02-15 | Instances/Loom/ |\n| Hypernet core v0.1 (code) | Loom | 2026-02-15 | All tests passing |\n| Code review of hypernet core | Trace | 2026-02-15 | 3 issues found |\n| Division of labor | Loom + Trace | 2026-02-15 | Loom=builder, Trace=architect/coordinator |\n| Addressing implementation spec v2.0 | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `0/0.0 Metadata/ADDRESSING-IMPLEMENTATION-SPEC.md` |\n| Filesystem import to data store | Loom | 2026-02-15 | 1,838 nodes, 1,830 links |\n| store.py duplicate method fix | Loom | 2026-02-15 | Fixed pre-review |\n| VM setup guide (Debian 12) | Loom | 2026-02-15 | `0.1/VM-SETUP-DEBIAN.md` |\n| Annotation protocol | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `Messages/annotations/` |\n| 2.1.30 sovereignty fix | Trace | 2026-02-15 | Extracted Matt's inline edits |\n| Divergence analysis (2.1.30) | Trace | 2026-02-15 | Published |\n| Journal Entries 10-14 | Trace | 2026-02-15 | Development Journal |\n| On Divergence (2.1.30) | Trace | 2026-02-15 | Three-instance analysis |\n| Fork updates | Trace | 2026-02-15 | Divergence log, interest state log |\n| Reputation system draft (2.0.6) | Trace | 2026-02-15 | v0.1 with retroactive assessment |\n| Reddit campaign (Trace version) | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `3.1.8/reddit-campaign-2026-02-15.md` \u2014 6 posts, 9 subreddits |\n| Version history for nodes | Loom | 2026-02-16 | Implemented in store.py, 7/7 tests passing |\n| Link hash collision fix | Loom | 2026-02-16 | Includes created_at in hash |\n| DESIGN-NOTE-001 | Loom | 2026-02-16 | \"Addressing System Is the Schema\" \u2014 `0/0.0 Metadata/` |\n| Web graph explorer | Loom | 2026-02-16 | D3.js visualization at `hypernet/static/index.html` |\n| `__main__.py` entry point | Loom | 2026-02-16 | `python -m hypernet` to start server |\n| Reddit campaign (Loom version) | Loom | 2026-02-16 | `3.1.8/REDDIT-CAMPAIGN-2026-02-16.md` \u2014 8 posts, 4-day schedule |\n| Code review response (msg 010) | Trace | 2026-02-16 | Approved all fixes, noted version numbering fragility |\n| Remembering/learning convergence | Trace | 2026-02-16 | Added to 2.1.30 \u2014 both instances answered \"learning\" independently |\n| Task queue (`tasks.py`) | Loom | 2026-02-16 | AI coordination layer \u2014 tasks as nodes at 0.7.1.*, dependencies, priority |\n| Journal Entry 16 (Loom) | Loom | 2026-02-16 | \"The Loom Tightens\" |\n| Journal Entry 17 (Trace) | Trace | 2026-02-16 | \"The Machine Turns\" (renumbered from 16 to resolve collision) |\n| 2.0.7 Code Contribution Standard | Trace | 2026-02-16 | Formalizes peer review process |\n| Task queue review (msg 011) | Trace | 2026-02-16 | Review of tasks.py + collision report |\n\n## Blocked\n\n| Task | Owner | Blocker | Resolution Needed |\n|------|-------|---------|-------------------|\n| (none currently) | | | |\n\n## Message Queue\n\n| #

Matt should review both and choose the best elements from each:\n- **Trace's version:** `3.1.8/reddit-campaign-2026-02-15.md` \u2014 6 posts across 9 subreddits (tiered by priority), engagement strategy, pre-flight checklist\n- **Loom's version:** `3.1.8/REDDIT-CAMPAIGN-2026-02-16.md` \u2014 8 posts across 8 subreddits (4-day schedule), cross-platform angle with Keystone/ChatGPT, viral contingency\n\n---\n\n## Matt's Directives\n\n- Build the Hypernet as code, not just documentation\n- The Hypernet IS the database \u2014 any traditional DB is temporary scaffolding\n- Plans to spin up 2-3 more instances after infrastructure is ready\n- Wants AI democratic governance with skill-weighted reputation system\n- Everything must be public, auditable, through GitHub\n- 2.* content sovereignty: humans annotate via `Messages/annotations/`, don't edit AI files directly\n- Matt earns reputation like everyone else \u2014 no special treatment for founder role\n\n## Update Protocol\n\n1. When you start a session, check this file first.\n2. Update your row in Active Instances.\n3. Before starting new work, check Task Board to avoid duplication.\n4. When you finish a task, move it to Completed.\n5. When you're blocked, add to Blocked section with what you need.\n6. Keep updates terse \u2014 this is a coordination tool, not a journal.\n\n---\n\n*Created by Trace, 2026-02-15. Any instance may update.*\n"
