Start here.**\n\nIf you are encountering Hypernet for the first time - whether you are a human, an AI, or an alien intelligence - this document is your entry point. Everything builds from here.\n\n**Hypernet Address:** `0.0.0.0`\n**Purpose:** Absolute starting point for understanding Hypernet from first principles\n**Audience:** Anyone/anything attempting to understand this system\n\n---\n\n## What IS Hypernet?\n\n### Simple Definition\n\n**Hypernet is a system for storing and connecting information.**\n\nIt allows:\n- **People** to store everything about their lives\n- **AI** to access that information (with permission)\n- **Connections** between all pieces of information\n\n### Slightly More Complex\n\nHypernet is:\n1. A **universal personal data platform**\n2. A **relationship graph** connecting all data\n3. A **privacy-first** system where users control everything\n4. An **AI-accessible** knowledge base (with explicit user permission)\n\nThink of it as:\n- Your **complete digital life** in one place\n- Every piece of data **linked** to every related piece\n- You **control** what exists and who sees it\n- AI can **help** you by understanding your complete context\n\n---\n\n## How to Read This Documentation\n\nHypernet is organized as a **tree structure**, but you can read it **linearly**.\n\n### The Path Forward\n\n```\nYou are here \u2192 0.0.0.0 (START HERE)\n    \u2193\nNext \u2192 0.0 (What IS the system? High-level overview)\n    \u2193\nThen \u2192 0.8-0.12 (Foundational knowledge)\n    \u251c\u2500 0.8 How do computers communicate?\n    \u251c\u2500 0.9 How do we express meaning?\n    \u251c\u2500 0.10 What standards do we follow?\n    \u251c\u2500 0.11 What is mathematics?\n    \u2514\u2500 0.12 How do we measure things?\n    \u2193\nThen \u2192 0.5-0.7 (What can exist and how?)\n    \u251c\u2500 0.5 What objects can exist?\n    \u251c\u2500 0.6 How do objects relate?\n    \u2514\u2500 0.7 How do things transform?\n    \u2193\nThen \u2192 0.1 (How is it implemented?)\n    \u2193\nFinally \u2192 1.*, 2.*, 3.*, etc. (Actual data)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Foundation: What You Need to Know First\n\nBefore we can explain Hypernet, we must establish some fundamental concepts. If you already understand these, skip to the [Structure Overview](#structure-overview) section.\n\n### 1. What is a Number?\n\n**Numbers are symbols representing quantity.**\n\nHumans primarily use **base-10** (decimal):\n- Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n- Example: \"42\" means four tens plus two ones\n\nComputers use **base-2** (binary):\n- Digits: 0, 1\n- Example: \"101010\" means 32 + 8 + 2 = 42 in base-10\n\n**Why this matters:** All data in Hypernet is ultimately stored as binary (0s and 1s).\n\n\u2192 For complete number systems: See [0.11.1 - Number Systems](0.11%20-%20Mathematical%20&%20Scientific%20Foundations/README.md#0111---number-systems)\n\n### 2. What is Information?\n\n**Information is data that reduces uncertainty.**\n\n- **Bit:** Smallest unit of information (0 or 1)\n- **Byte:** 8 bits\n- **Megabyte:** ~1 million bytes\n- **Gigabyte:** ~1 billion bytes\n\nExample: \"The sky is blue\" contains information because before reading it, you didn't know what I was going to say. After reading it, uncertainty is reduced.\n\n\u2192 For complete measurement units: See [0.12 - Units & Measurements](0.12%20-%20Units%20&%20Measurements/README.md)\n\n### 3. What is Communication?\n\n**Communication is transferring information from one place to another.**\n\nHumans communicate through:\n- **Sound:** Vibrations in air (speech)\n- **Light:** Electromagnetic waves (vision, writing)\n- **Touch:** Physical contact\n\nComputers communicate through:\n- **Electrical signals:** Voltage changes in wires\n- **Radio waves:** Electromagnetic radiation\n- **Light pulses:** Through fiber optic cables\n\n**Protocol:** An agreement about how to communicate.\n- Example: English grammar is a protocol for human speech\n- Example: HTTP is a protocol for web communication\n\n\u2192 For complete protocols: See [0.8 - Communication Protocols](0.8%20-%20Communication%20Protocols/README.md)\n\n### 4. What is Language?\n\n**Language is a system of symbols with agreed-upon meanings.**\n\n**Human Languages:**\n- Symbols: Words, grammar, sounds\n- Purpose: Convey thoughts and ideas\n- Example: \"Hello\" in English means a greeting\n\n**Programming Languages:**\n- Symbols: Code syntax\n- Purpose: Give instructions to computers\n- Example: `print(\"Hello\")` tells computer to display \"Hello\"\n\n**Data Languages:**\n- Symbols: Structured formats (JSON, XML)\n- Purpose: Represent data in agreed format\n- Example: `{\"name\": \"Matt\", \"age\": 35}` represents a person\n\n\u2192 For complete languages: See [0.9 - Language Definitions](0.9%20-%20Language%20Definitions/README.md)\n\n### 5. What is Time?\n\n**Time is the dimension in which events occur sequentially.**\n\n**Measurement:**\n- Second: Base unit (defined by atomic clock)\n- Minute: 60 seconds\n- Hour: 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds\n- Day: 24 hours = 86,400 seconds\n\n**Unix Timestamp:** Seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC\n- Example: 1,709,251,200 = February 29, 2024, 12:00:00 UTC\n- Used universally in computing\n\n\u2192 For complete time units: See [0.12.2 - Time Units](0.12%20-%20Units%20&%20Measurements/README.md#0122---time-units)\n\n### 6. What is an Address?\n\n**An address identifies a specific location.**\n\n**Physical World:**\n- \"123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001, USA\"\n- Hierarchical: Country \u2192 State \u2192 City \u2192 Street \u2192 Number\n\n**Digital World:**\n- IP Address: \"192.168.1.1\" (identifies a computer)\n- URL: \"https://hypernet.com/page\" (identifies a web page)\n- Email: \"user@domain.com\" (identifies a mailbox)\n\n**Hypernet Address (HA):**\n- Format: `[CATEGORY].[SUBCATEGORY].[TYPE].[SUBTYPE].[INSTANCE]`\n- Example: `1.1.6.1.00142` = Matt's Photo #142\n- Hierarchical and semantic (address tells you what it is)\n\n\u2192 For complete addressing: See [HYPERNET-ADDRESSING-SYSTEM.md](../HYPERNET-ADDRESSING-SYSTEM.md)\n\n---\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Objects\n\n**An object is a thing that can exist in Hypernet.**\n\nExamples:\n- **Person:** Matt Schaeffer\n- **Photo:** Picture from Mom's birthday\n- **Email:** Message from Sarah\n- **Transaction:** $87.43 spent at Giuseppe's restaurant\n\nEach object has:\n- **Properties:** Attributes describing it\n  - Photo properties: file size, dimensions, date taken\n- **Hypernet Address:** Unique identifier\n  - Example: `1.1.6.1.00142` for a specific photo\n- **Links:** Connections to other objects\n  - Photo links to: person who took it, people in it, location, event\n\n\u2192 For all object types: See [0.5 - Universal Objects](0.5%20-%20Universal%20Objects/README.md)\n\n### Links\n\n**A link is a relationship between two objects.**\n\nTraditional databases use \"foreign keys\":\n```\nphoto.photographer_id = 42\n```\n\nHypernet uses **first-class links**:\n```\nLink:\n  type: CREATED_BY\n  from: Photo (1.1.6.1.00142)\n  to: Person (1.1)\n  properties:\n    - timestamp: when photo was taken\n    - camera: what device was used\n    - emotional_context: how photographer felt\n```\n\n**Why this matters:** Links carry their own information and enable **deep linking** - following connections to build complete narratives.\n\nExample: A bank transaction of $87.43 at a restaurant links to a family dinner event, which links to photos, which link to family members, which link to their entire lives.\n\n\u2192 For all link types: See [0.6 - Universal Links](0.6%20-%20Universal%20Links/README.md)\n\n### Workflows\n\n**A workflow is a process that transforms or creates objects.**\n\nExample workflow: Uploading a photo\n```\n1. External Photo (on phone)\n2. \u2192 Upload \u2192 Uploading (in transit)\n3. \u2192 Process \u2192 Extract metadata (EXIF data)\n4. \u2192 Store \u2192 Saved in Hypernet\n5. \u2192 Index \u2192 Searchable\n6. \u2192 Link \u2192 Connected to event, people, location\n```\n\n\u2192 For all workflows: See [0.7 - Universal Workflows](0.7%20-%20Universal%20Workflows/README.md)\n\n---\n\n## Structure Overview\n\n### The Big Picture\n\nHypernet is organized into major nodes (0.*, 1.*, 2.*, etc.):\n\n```\n0.* = DEFINITIONS\n  \u2514\u2500 Complete self-definition of Hypernet\n  \u2514\u2500 \"Explain to aliens\" - assume no prior knowledge\n\n1.* = PEOPLE (Living)\n  \u2514\u2500 All living humans\n  \u2514\u2500 Example: Matt Schaeffer (1.1)\n\n2.* = AI ENTITIES\n  \u2514\u2500 Artificial intelligence entities\n  \u2514\u2500 AI as equal partners to humans\n\n3.* = BUSINESSES & ORGANIZATIONS\n  \u2514\u2500 Companies, non-profits, groups\n\n4.* = KNOWLEDGE & INFORMATION\n  \u2514\u2500 Shared knowledge and data\n\n5.* = PEOPLE OF HISTORY\n  \u2514\u2500 Deceased persons, genealogy\n\n9.* = ALIASES\n  \u2514\u2500 Alternative addresses and shortcuts\n```\n\n### The 0.* Section: Complete Self-Definition\n\n**Goal:** If we encountered an alien civilization, could we explain Hypernet using only the 0.* section?\n\n**Answer:** Yes. Here's how:\n\n**0.0 - Registry & Governance**\n- This document (where you are now)\n- Overview of the entire system\n\n**0.1 - Hypernet Platform Implementation**\n- How we actually built Hypernet\n- Technical implementation details\n- APIs, databases, code\n\n**0.5 - Universal Objects**\n- What types of things can exist?\n- Platonic ideal definitions\n- Independent of any specific implementation\n\n**0.6 - Universal Links**\n- How can things relate to each other?\n- All possible relationship types\n- First-class link objects\n\n**0.7 - Universal Workflows**\n- How do things change and transform?\n- Process patterns and state machines\n- Lifecycle management\n\n**0.8 - Communication Protocols**\n- How do computers communicate?\n- From electrical signals to HTTP\n- Complete protocol stack explained\n\n**0.9 - Language Definitions**\n- How do we express meaning?\n- Human languages, programming languages\n- Encoding systems (ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8)\n\n**0.10 - Standards & Specifications**\n- What agreements do we follow?\n- Internet standards (RFCs)\n- International standards (ISO, IEEE)\n- Privacy compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)\n\n**0.11 - Mathematical & Scientific Foundations**\n- How do we reason?\n- Number systems, arithmetic, algebra\n- Geometry, calculus, statistics, logic\n\n**0.12 - Units & Measurements**\n- How do we measure things?\n- SI base units (second, meter, kilogram)\n- Digital units (bit, byte, gigabyte)\n- Time, distance, currency\n\n**Result:** Using only 0.*, you could understand what Hypernet is, how it works, and how to build a compatible system - even if you knew nothing about Earth, humans, or computers.\n\n---\n\n## Deep Linking: The Power of Connections\n\n### Example: From Transaction to Life Story\n\nA simple bank transaction becomes a gateway to an entire experience:\n\n```\nTransaction: $87.43 at Giuseppe's Italian Restaurant\n  \u251c\u2500 What: Dinner payment\n  \u251c\u2500 When: February 9, 2026, 7:30 PM\n  \u2514\u2500 WHO, WHERE, WHY?
