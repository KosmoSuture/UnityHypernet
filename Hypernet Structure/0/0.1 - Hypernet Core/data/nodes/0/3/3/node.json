All votes are recorded permanently and can be audited by any participant.\n\n## Eligibility\n\n### Basic Eligibility\n```yaml\nvoting_eligibility:\n  verified_human: true\n  minimum_reputation: 0.3\n  account_age_days: 30\n  no_active_sanctions: true\n```\n\n### Enhanced Eligibility (for certain votes)\n```yaml\nenhanced_eligibility:\n  minimum_reputation: 0.6\n  participation_months: 6\n  contribution_verified: true\n```\n\n## Voting Methods\n\n### 1. Simple Majority\n- Used for: Routine decisions, working group matters\n- Threshold: > 50% of votes cast\n- Quorum: 10% of eligible voters\n\n### 2. Supermajority\n- Used for: Policy changes, budget approval\n- Threshold: \u2265 66% of votes cast\n- Quorum: 20% of eligible voters\n\n### 3. Constitutional Supermajority\n- Used for: Governance changes, protocol upgrades\n- Threshold: \u2265 75% of votes cast\n- Quorum: 33% of eligible voters\n\n### 4. Expertise-Weighted Voting\n- Used for: Technical decisions\n- Weight calculation:\n  ```\n  vote_weight = base_weight \u00d7 (1 + expertise_score \u00d7 2)\n  ```\n- Maximum weight: 3\u00d7 base weight\n\n### 5. Quadratic Voting\n- Used for: Resource allocation, prioritization\n- Cost formula: `cost = votes\u00b2`\n- Each participant has equal voting credits\n\n### 6. Ranked Choice\n- Used for: Elections, multi-option decisions\n- Instant runoff elimination\n- Ensures majority support for winner\n\n## Voting Process\n\n### Phase 1: Proposal\n```yaml\nproposal:\n  id: \"[Unique identifier]\"\n  title: \"Proposal title\"\n  author: \"[Mandala ID]\"\n  type: \"policy|technical|constitutional|election\"\n  summary: \"Brief description\"\n  full_text: \"[Document link]\"\n  discussion_link: \"[Forum thread]\"\n  submitted: \"2025-01-30T00:00:00Z\"\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Discussion\n- Minimum discussion period based on proposal type:\n  | Type | Minimum Period |\n  |------|---------------|\n  | Routine | 3 days |\n  | Policy | 14 days |\n  | Technical | 30 days |\n  | Constitutional | 90 days |\n\n- Discussion happens on public forum\n- Amendments can be proposed\n- Author can withdraw or modify\n\n### Phase 3: Voting\n```yaml\nvoting_period:\n  start: \"2025-02-15T00:00:00Z\"\n  end: \"2025-02-22T00:00:00Z\"\n  duration_days: 7\n  voting_method: \"simple_majority\"\n  eligible_voters: 12345\n  quorum_required: 1235\n```\n\n### Phase 4: Tallying\n- Votes encrypted until period ends\n- Decryption requires multi-party computation\n- Results calculated and published\n- Verification period (24 hours)\n\n### Phase 5: Implementation\n- If passed: Implementation plan executed\n- If failed: Cooldown before resubmission (30 days)\n\n## Vote Recording\n\n### Vote Structure\n```yaml\nvote_record:\n  vote_id: \"[Unique identifier]\"\n  proposal_id: \"[Proposal ID]\"\n  voter: \"[Mandala ID]\"  # Can be anonymized for privacy\n  choice: \"yes|no|abstain\"\n  weight: 1.5  # If weighted voting\n  timestamp: \"2025-02-16T14:32:00Z\"\n  signature: \"[Cryptographic signature]\"\n```\n\n### Privacy Options\n- **Public Vote**: Voter identity visible\n- **Anonymous Vote**: Voter hidden, verifiable by voter only\n- **Shielded Vote**: Full privacy with ZK proof of eligibility\n\n## Delegation\n\n### Liquid Democracy\nParticipants can delegate their votes:\n```yaml\ndelegation:\n  delegator: \"[Mandala ID]\"\n  delegate: \"[Mandala ID]\"\n  scope: \"all|category|specific_proposal\"\n  category: \"technical|community|financial\"\n  revocable: true\n  expires: \"2025-12-31\"\n```\n\n### Delegation Rules\n- Delegations are transitive (A\u2192B\u2192C allowed)\n- Maximum delegation chain: 5 levels\n- Delegator can override on specific votes\n- Delegation publicly visible\n\n## Anti-Manipulation Measures\n\n### Sybil Resistance\n- One person = one vote (verified identity)\n- Reputation requirements\n- Stake requirements for certain votes\n\n### Vote Buying Prevention\n- Votes cannot be proven to third parties\n- No conditional vote verification\n- Anonymous voting option\n\n### Timing Attacks\n- Vote contents hidden until period ends\n- Commitment scheme prevents late manipulation\n- Time-locked cryptography\n\n## Related Documents\n\n- 0.3.0 Governance Overview\n- 0.3.3 Reputation System\n- 0.7.1 Election Workflows\n- 0.8.3 Voting Cryptography\n"
