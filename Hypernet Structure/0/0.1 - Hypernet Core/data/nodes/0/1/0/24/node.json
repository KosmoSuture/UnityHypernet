If you wait, you'll forget details.\n\n### Add personal notes\n\"Liked the demo, concerned about competition\"\n\"Very excited, wants to meet team\"\n\"Asked about revenue model - seemed skeptical\"\n\nThese notes help you iterate your pitch.\n\n### Track referrals\nIf Investor A intro you to Investor B, note that. Warm intros convert 10x better.\n\n### Don't give up too early\n\"No response\" after 1 email isn't a rejection. Try 2-3 times before marking as \"Pass.\"\n\n### Celebrate milestones\n- First response: \ud83c\udf89\n- First meeting: \ud83c\udf89\n- First \"very interested\": \ud83c\udf89\n- First term sheet: \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n- First $ committed: \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n## Your Week 1 Goal\n\n**By Friday EOD:**\n- [ ] 50 emails sent (tracked in spreadsheet)\n- [ ] 10-15 responses received\n- [ ] 3-5 meetings scheduled\n- [ ] Spreadsheet updated daily\n- [ ] Ready for Week 2 meetings\n\n---\n\n**Now go create that spreadsheet!** \ud83d\udcca\n\nCopy the structure above into Google Sheets right now.
