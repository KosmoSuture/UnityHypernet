I'm Matt Schaeffer, and I'm here to talk about the missing infrastructure layer for the AI revolution. We're building Hypernet - the data platform that enables personal AI agents.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 2: The Problem\n\n**Visual:** Split screen showing:\n- Left: Person surrounded by logos (Google, Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) with data streams flowing TO the companies\n- Right: Same person with AI assistant, but assistant showing \"???\" - can't access the data\n\n**Headline:** Your AI Assistant is Artificially Stupid\n\n**Key Points:**\n\u2022 You create 2GB of data per day across 50+ platforms\n\u2022 That data is worth $500-5,000/year to Big Tech\n\u2022 AI assistants need this data to be useful\n\u2022 But there's no infrastructure to access it ethically\n\n**Bottom Text:** \"The problem: Personal AI can't access personal data\"\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Let me show you the problem. You generate massive amounts of data - emails, calendar, photos, messages, purchases. Big Tech makes billions selling this data. But when you try to use ChatGPT or Claude as a personal assistant, they're blind to your actual life. They can't see your calendar, read your emails, or understand your preferences. Why? Because there's no infrastructure to give AI systems access to YOUR data in a privacy-preserving way.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 3: The Market Opportunity\n\n**Visual:** Three concentric circles (TAM/SAM/SOM) with dollar amounts\n\n**Headline:** A $4.5 Trillion Market\n\n**Key Metrics:**\n```\nTAM (Total Addressable Market)\n$4.5 Trillion\n4.5B internet users \u00d7 $1,000/year\n\nSAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)\n$50 Billion\n1B users in developed markets \u00d7 5% penetration\n\nSOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)\n$5 Billion\n10M users by Year 5 \u00d7 $500 ARPU\n```\n\n**Key Trends:**\n\u2022 AI market growing 40% YoY ($500B in 2026)\n\u2022 Data privacy regulations forcing change (GDPR, CCPA)\n\u2022 Consumer backlash against Big Tech surveillance\n\u2022 Personal AI assistants emerging as primary interface\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"This is a massive market. The personal data industry is worth $4.5 trillion globally. Even capturing a tiny fraction of this - 1% - is a $45 billion opportunity. Our serviceable obtainable market is $5 billion by year 5, which at a 10x revenue multiple makes us a $50 billion company.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 4: The Solution - Product Demo\n\n**Visual:** Product screenshot showing:\n- Clean dashboard with connected services\n- Data flowing from various sources into Hypernet\n- API endpoints being accessed by AI applications\n\n**Headline:** The Data Layer for Personal AI\n\n**What We Built:**\n\u2713 Universal data platform (19 data types)\n\u2713 61 REST API endpoints (production-ready)\n\u2713 Privacy-first architecture\n\u2713 OAuth integrations for 100+ services (roadmap)\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. User connects their accounts (Google, Instagram, email, etc.)\n2. Hypernet imports and normalizes data\n3. User grants permission to AI apps\n4. Apps get rich context through our API\n5. User maintains control + gets compensated\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Here's what we've built. Hypernet is a universal data platform that sits between your personal data sources and the AI applications you want to use. We've built 19 data models covering everything from photos to emails to calendar events. We have 61 production-ready API endpoints. This isn't vaporware - the technology is built and working.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 5: Business Model\n\n**Visual:** Three-column layout showing revenue streams\n\n**Headline:** Multiple Revenue Streams, High Margins\n\n**Revenue Model 1: B2B API (Primary - 70% of revenue)**\n```\nWho: AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)\nWhat: Pay per API call\nPricing: $0.01-0.10 per API call\nVolume: 1M API calls/month = $10K-100K MRR per enterprise customer\nMargins: 85% gross margin\n```\n\n**Revenue Model 2: B2C Premium (25% of revenue)**\n```\nWho: Power users, privacy advocates\nWhat: Monthly subscription\nPricing: $10-50/month\nFeatures: Unlimited integrations, advanced controls, AI training\nMargins: 90% gross margin\n```\n\n**Revenue Model 3: Data Licensing (5% of revenue)**\n```\nWho: Researchers, ethical AI companies\nWhat: Aggregated, anonymized data (opt-in only)\nPricing: Custom enterprise contracts\nUse Case: Training better AI models with diverse, consensual data\nMargins: 95% gross margin\n```\n\n**Unit Economics:**\n\u2022 LTV: $2,400 (B2C) to $480,000 (B2B)\n\u2022 CAC: $200 (B2C) to $25,000 (B2B)\n\u2022 LTV:CAC Ratio: 12:1 (B2C), 19:1 (B2B)\n\u2022 Payback Period: 8 months (B2C), 6 months (B2B)\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Our business model has three revenue streams. Primary is B2B - AI companies pay us per API call. At scale, each enterprise customer is worth $480,000 in lifetime value. We also have consumer subscriptions and ethical data licensing. The margins are exceptional - 85%+ across all revenue streams. This is a SaaS company with enterprise economics.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 6: Go-to-Market Strategy\n\n**Visual:** Flywheel diagram showing B2B2C motion\n\n**Headline:** B2B2C Flywheel\n\n**Phase 1: Strategic Partnerships (Months 0-12)**\n```\nTarget: 5-10 AI platform companies\nApproach: Build integrations, prove value\nExamples: Salesforce AI Cloud, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude\nResult: Enterprise contracts + user distribution\n```\n\n**Phase 2: Developer Ecosystem (Months 6-18)**\n```\nTarget: 10,000+ AI app developers\nApproach: Open API, documentation, SDKs\nExamples: Personal finance AI, health coach AI, productivity AI\nResult: 1,000+ apps built on Hypernet\n```\n\n**Phase 3: Direct to Consumer (Months 12-24)**\n```\nTarget: Early adopters, privacy advocates\nApproach: ProductHunt, content marketing, community\nExamples: Tech enthusiasts, data activists, power users\nResult: Viral growth, network effects\n```\n\n**The Flywheel:**\n1. AI companies integrate Hypernet \u2192 drive users to platform\n2. More users \u2192 more data \u2192 better AI \u2192 more value\n3. More value \u2192 more developers \u2192 more apps\n4. More apps \u2192 more users \u2192 network effects\n\n**CAC by Channel:**\n\u2022 Partnerships: $25K (but brings thousands of users)\n\u2022 Developers: $5K (but builds ecosystem)\n\u2022 Direct: $200 (viral coefficient 1.3)\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"Our go-to-market is a B2B2C flywheel. We start by partnering with AI platforms like Salesforce and Microsoft. They integrate Hypernet and drive their users to us. This gives us distribution at zero CAC. Then we open up to developers who build on our platform. Finally, we go direct to consumers. Each channel feeds the others, creating a powerful flywheel effect.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 7: Traction & Milestones\n\n**Visual:** Timeline with metrics and milestones\n\n**Headline:** Strong Foundation, Clear Path Forward\n\n**Completed (February 2026):**\n\u2713 19 data models built (Media, Email, Calendar, Social, Tasks, Notes, etc.)\n\u2713 61 REST API endpoints production-ready\n\u2713 Authentication & authorization system complete\n\u2713 Database schema optimized and tested\n\u2713 Auto-generated API documentation\n\u2713 Privacy-first architecture designed\n\n**Current Metrics:**\n\u2022 Beta Users: [Launching in 30 days - target 100]\n\u2022 API Calls: [Not launched yet]\n\u2022 Revenue: [Pre-revenue]\n\u2022 Partnerships: [2-3 in discussion]\n\n**Next 90 Days:**\n\u25a1 Launch closed beta (target: 1,000 users)\n\u25a1 Sign 2-3 partnership LOIs with AI companies\n\u25a1 Generate first revenue ($10-50K MRR)\n\u25a1 Hire CTO and 2-3 engineers\n\u25a1 Build showcase integrations (ChatGPT, Claude)\n\n**12-Month Milestones:**\n\u25a1 10,000+ users\n\u25a1 $500K MRR\n\u25a1 5-7 strategic partnerships signed\n\u25a1 25-person team\n\u25a1 Public launch (out of beta)\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"We have strong technical foundation. Unlike most pre-seed companies pitching, we have actual working technology - 61 APIs ready to go. We're launching beta in 30 days with a target of 1,000 users in 90 days. We're in partnership discussions with several AI companies. With this round of funding, we'll hit $500K MRR and 10,000 users within 12 months.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 8: Competition & Why We Win\n\n**Visual:** Competitive landscape matrix (Privacy vs. Utility axes)\n\n**Headline:** No Direct Competition in Personal AI Infrastructure\n\n**Quadrant 1: Big Tech (High Utility, Low Privacy)**\n\u2022 Google, Apple, Microsoft\n\u2022 Own your data, closed ecosystems\n\u2022 Why they can't compete: Conflict of interest - their business model depends on owning user data\n\n**Quadrant 2: Privacy Projects (High Privacy, Low Utility)**\n\u2022 Solid (Tim Berners-Lee), Digi.me, Meeco\n\u2022 Too early, no AI integration, failed to gain traction\n\u2022 Why we're different: AI-native from day one, perfect timing\n\n**Quadrant 3: Data Brokers (Low Privacy, Low Utility)**\n\u2022 Acxiom, Epsilon, LiveRamp\n\u2022 Sell your data without consent\n\u2022 Why we're different: User control + compensation\n\n**Quadrant 4: Hypernet (High Privacy, High Utility)** \u2b50\n\u2022 Privacy-first + AI-powered\n\u2022 User control + real utility\n\u2022 Perfect timing + strong execution\n\n**Our Competitive Moats:**\n1. **First-Mover Advantage** - Building now while market is forming\n2. **Network Effects** - More users = more value for developers\n3. **Data Gravity** - Hard to switch once data is in\n4. **Strategic Partnerships** - Exclusive deals with AI companies\n5. **Trust & Brand** - Privacy-first reputation Big Tech can't replicate\n6. **Technical Complexity** - Years to build 100+ integrations\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"There's no direct competition. Big Tech can't do this because it conflicts with their business model. Privacy projects missed the AI revolution. We're the only company building AI-native personal data infrastructure with a privacy-first approach. Our moats are strong - first-mover advantage, network effects, data gravity, and strategic partnerships that lock out competitors.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 9: Market Timing & Catalysts\n\n**Visual:** Timeline showing converging trends\n\n**Headline:** Perfect Timing - Three Mega-Trends Converging\n\n**Trend 1: AI Revolution (Technology Push)**\n```\n2022: ChatGPT launches, proves conversational AI works\n2023-2024: Claude, Gemini, GPT-4 show dramatic improvements\n2025: Personal AI assistants go mainstream\n2026: AI companies desperate for personal context \u2190 WE ARE HERE\n2027+: Personal AI becomes primary computing interface\n```\n\n**Trend 2: Data Privacy Regulations (Regulatory Pull)**\n```\n2018: GDPR passes in EU (data portability required)\n2020: CCPA in California\n2023-2024: Multiple states pass privacy laws\n2025: Federal privacy law discussions\n2026: Enforcement ramping up \u2190 WE ARE HERE\n2027+: Compliance requires solutions like Hypernet\n```\n\n**Trend 3: Consumer Backlash (Market Pull)**\n```\n2020-2022: Post-Cambridge Analytica awareness\n2023-2024: Growing distrust of Big Tech\n2025: \"Data sovereignty\" movement grows\n2026: Consumers demanding control \u2190 WE ARE HERE\n2027+: User-owned data becomes expectation\n```\n\n**Why Now is Perfect:**\n\u2022 AI companies NEED personal data infrastructure (they're building agents but have no data access)\n\u2022 Regulations REQUIRE data portability (companies must comply or face massive fines)\n\u2022 Users WANT data control (proven by survey data, privacy app adoption)\n\u2022 Technology EXISTS to do this right (APIs, OAuth, encryption, on-device processing)\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"The timing couldn't be better. Three massive trends are converging right now. AI companies need personal data to make their assistants useful. Regulators are forcing data portability. Consumers are demanding control. We're building the infrastructure that solves all three problems at exactly the right moment. This window won't stay open forever.\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10: Team & Advisors\n\n**Visual:** Headshots with credentials\n\n**Headline:** Experienced Team, World-Class Advisors\n\n**Current Team:**\n\n**Matt Schaeffer - Founder & CEO**\n```\n\u2022 [Your background - fill in]\n\u2022 Vision: Personal AI + data sovereignty\n\u2022 Responsibilities: Strategy, fundraising, partnerships\n```\n\n**[Co-founder/CTO - Hiring]**\n```\n\u2022 Target: Staff+ engineer from FAANG or leading AI company\n\u2022 Background: Distributed systems, API infrastructure\n\u2022 Equity: 8-12%\n\u2022 Status: Active search, 3 strong candidates\n```\n\n**Advisors (Recruiting):**\n\n**[AI/ML Expert]** - Former [Company] AI Researcher\n\u2022 Advising on: AI integration strategy, technical architecture\n\u2022 0.5% equity\n\n**[Privacy/Security Expert]** - Former GDPR Regulator\n\u2022 Advising on: Compliance, privacy architecture, regulatory strategy\n\u2022 0.25% equity\n\n**[Enterprise SaaS Expert]** - Scaled [Company] to $100M revenue\n\u2022 Advising on: Go-to-market, enterprise sales, partnerships\n\u2022 0.5% equity\n\n**[Investor/Advisor]** - Partner at [Top VC Firm]\n\u2022 Advising on: Fundraising, strategy, investor intros\n\u2022 0.25% equity\n\n**Hiring Plan (with this round):**\n\u2022 Month 1: CTO + VP Engineering\n\u2022 Month 2: 3 Senior Engineers\n\u2022 Month 3: Head of Product + 2 Product Managers\n\u2022 Month 4-6: Sales, Marketing, Operations\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n\"We're building a world-class team.
