Think Snowflake for your digital life, or Plaid for personal data. Big Tech makes $500 billion a year selling our data - we're enabling individuals to own, control, and monetize their own data while powering the next generation of AI assistants. We have the APIs built, partnerships forming, and need capital to scale.\\\"\\n\\n**Version 2 (Corporate Strategic Focus):**\\n> \\\"Your AI products need richer personal context to deliver real value, but you can't access user data ethically or legally. We've built the missing infrastructure - a privacy-first data platform that gives AI systems access to personal data WITH user consent and control. We're talking to Salesforce, Microsoft, and Anthropic about partnerships and investment.\\\"\\n\\n**Version 3 (Grant/Policy Focus):**\\n> \\\"Data sovereignty is a human rights issue. Three companies control 80% of personal data, and individuals have no rights or compensation. We're building open infrastructure that returns data ownership to individuals while enabling responsible AI development. This aligns with GDPR, supports democratic values, and creates economic opportunity for billions of people.\\\"\\n\\n### The Problem Statement (60 seconds)\\n\\n**Current State:**\\n- You create ~2GB of data per day across 50+ platforms\\n- That data is worth $500-5000/year, but you see $0\\n- Big Tech mines it to train AI, sell ads, manipulate behavior\\n- You can't export it, combine it, or use it for YOUR benefit\\n- Even if you could, there's no infrastructure to make it useful\\n\\n**Pain Points:**\\n1. **For Individuals:** No control, no compensation, privacy invasion\\n2. **For AI Companies:** Can't access quality personal data ethically\\n3. **For Developers:** No standardized way to build personal AI apps\\n4. **For Society:** Concentration of power, surveillance capitalism\\n\\n**Why Now:**\\n- GDPR/CCPA forcing data portability\\n- AI boom creating desperate need for personal data\\n- Claude, ChatGPT proving AI assistants work - but need better context\\n- Growing consumer backlash against Big Tech\\n\\n### The Solution (60 seconds)\\n\\n**What We Built:**\\n- Universal data platform connecting 100+ sources (eventually)\\n- APIs for developers to build personal AI applications\\n- Privacy-first architecture (user owns data, grants permission)\\n- Open standards for data portability\\n\\n**How It Works:**\\n1. User connects their accounts (Google, Instagram, email, calendar, etc.)\\n2. Hypernet imports and normalizes their data\\n3. User grants permission to apps/AI services\\n4. Apps get rich personal context through our API\\n5. User maintains control, gets compensation\\n\\n**Technical Architecture:**\\n- 19 data models (Media, Emails, Tasks, Calendar, Social, etc.)\\n- REST APIs with 61 endpoints (already built)\\n- PostgreSQL + cloud storage\\n- OAuth for secure integrations\\n- On-device processing option for maximum privacy\\n\\n**Business Model:**\\n1. **B2B (Primary):** AI companies pay for API access ($0.01-0.10 per API call)\\n2. **B2C Premium:** Power users pay $10-50/month for advanced features\\n3. **Data Licensing:** Aggregated, anonymous data for research (opt-in only)\\n4. **Enterprise:** White-label for companies wanting private deployment\\n\\n### The Market Opportunity (90 seconds)\\n\\n**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**\\n- 4.5B internet users globally\\n- $1,000 average annual value per user (conservative)\\n- **$4.5 Trillion total market**\\n\\n**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**\\n- Focus: U.S. + Europe + high-income countries (1B users)\\n- Penetration: 5% in year 5\\n- **$50B annual revenue potential**\\n\\n**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):**\\n- Year 5 target: 10M users, $500M revenue\\n- **$5B company at 10x revenue multiple**\\n\\n**Market Segments:**\\n\\n| Segment | Size | Our Approach | Revenue Potential |\\n|---------|------|--------------|-------------------|\\n| **Personal AI Assistants** | Every human | B2C subscription | $50B/year |\\n| **AI Platform Companies** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | B2B API | $20B/year |\\n| **Enterprise AI** | Salesforce, Microsoft, SAP | Enterprise licensing | $30B/year |\\n| **Developers** | 25M+ developers building AI apps | API fees | $10B/year |\\n| **Data Researchers** | Universities, think tanks | Anonymous data | $5B/year |\\n\\n**Comparable Markets:**\\n- Cloud data platforms: Snowflake ($50B), Databricks ($43B)\\n- Financial data APIs: Plaid ($13B valuation), Stripe ($95B)\\n- Marketing data: LiveRamp ($10B), Segment (sold for $3.2B)\\n\\n**Why We Win:**\\n- First-mover in personal AI data infrastructure\\n- Network effects (more users = more value for developers)\\n- Data gravity (user data keeps them locked in)\\n- Impossible for Big Tech to compete (conflict of interest)\\n\\n### The Competition (60 seconds)\\n\\n**Direct Competitors (Sort Of):**\\n\\n1. **Solid (Tim Berners-Lee)** - Failed\\n   - Why: Too early, too technical, no clear use case\\n   - How we're different: AI agents are the killer app they missed\\n\\n2. **Meeco, Digi.me, Hub of All Things** - Small\\n   - Why: No developer ecosystem, no AI integration\\n   - How we're different: API-first, AI-native platform\\n\\n3. **Apple (Private Cloud Compute)** - Not competing\\n   - Why: Only for Apple users, closed ecosystem\\n   - How we're different: Platform-agnostic, open APIs\\n\\n4. **Google Takeout, Apple Data Export** - Not competing\\n   - Why: Data dumps, not infrastructure\\n   - How we're different: Live APIs, not static exports\\n\\n**Indirect Competitors:**\\n\\n5. **Big Tech building their own AI**\\n   - Why they won't do this: Conflict of interest (can't let users control data they monetize)\\n   - Our advantage: Neutral third party, privacy-first\\n\\n6. **Enterprise data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks)**\\n   - Why they won't do this: Focused on business data, not personal\\n   - Our advantage: Personal data expertise, consumer relationships\\n\\n**Competitive Moats:**\\n\\n1. **First-Mover Advantage** - Building now while market is forming\\n2. **Network Effects** - More users \\u2192 more developers \\u2192 more value\\n3. **Data Gravity** - Hard to switch once your data is in\\n4. **Strategic Partnerships** - Exclusive deals with AI companies\\n5. **Trust & Brand** - Privacy-first reputation impossible for Big Tech to replicate\\n6. **Technical Complexity** - 100+ integration points takes years to build\\n\\n### The Traction (What We Have)\\n\\n**Current State (as of Feb 2026):**\\n\\n**Product:**\\n- \\u2705 19 data models built (Media, Social, Email, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, etc.)\\n- \\u2705 61 REST API endpoints complete\\n- \\u2705 Authentication & authorization working (JWT)\\n- \\u2705 Database schema production-ready\\n- \\u2705 OpenAPI documentation auto-generated\\n- \\u23f3 User interface in development\\n- \\u23f3 First integrations being built\\n\\n**Team:**\\n- Matt Schaeffer -

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this crisp.\\n\\nBefore I dive in, I'd love to understand: what's your current thesis on AI infrastructure? What are you excited about in this space?\\n\\n[Listen actively, take notes]\\n\\nGreat. That's super relevant to what we're building. Let me show you why.\\n```\\n\\n### Minutes 5-10: The Problem\\n\\n**Goal:** Make them feel the pain\\n\\n```\\nLet me start with a question: how much do you think your personal data is worth?\\n\\n[Let them guess]\\n\\nConservative estimates: $500 to $5,000 per person per year. The data broker industry is $200B+. But you see $0 of that value.\\n\\nMore importantly, AI companies are desperate for personal data. ChatGPT and Claude are impressive, but they're artificially stupid because they don't know YOU.\\n\\n[Show example: \\\"Claude, plan my week\\\" without personal data vs. with calendar/email/tasks integrated]\\n\\nSee the difference? Without personal context, AI assistants can't deliver real value. But there's no infrastructure to provide that context ethically and legally.\\n\\nThat's what we're building.\\n```\\n\\n### Minutes 10-15: The Solution\\n\\n**Goal:** Show what you've built\\n\\n```\\nWe've built a universal personal data platform. Think of it as:\\n\\u2022 Plaid for personal data\\n\\u2022 Snowflake for your digital life\\n\\u2022 The data layer for personal AI agents\\n\\nHere's how it works:\\n[Quick product demo - 2 minutes]\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\u2022 19 data models covering everything from photos to emails to calendar\\n\\u2022 61 REST API endpoints - production ready\\n\\u2022 Privacy-first architecture\\n\\u2022 Partnerships forming with [AI companies]\\n\\nThe business model is simple:\\n\\u2022 AI companies pay us per API call ($0.01-0.10 depending on data type)\\n\\u2022 Power users pay subscription for advanced features\\n\\u2022 We're building the infrastructure layer, not competing with apps\\n\\n[Show diagram of data flow and business model]\\n```\\n\\n### Minutes 15-20: The Market & Opportunity\\n\\n**Goal:** Show the upside\\n\\n```\\nThis is a massive market:\\n\\u2022 TAM: $4.5 trillion (all personal data globally)\\n\\u2022 SAM: $50 billion (U.S. + Europe)\\n\\u2022 Our target: $500M revenue by year 5\\n\\nWhy we'll win:\\n1. First-mover advantage - no one else has built this\\n2. Network effects - more users = more value for developers\\n3. Strategic partnerships - we're talking to everyone who needs this\\n4. Big Tech can't compete - it's against their business model\\n\\nComparable exits:\\n\\u2022 Snowflake: $50B+ market cap\\n\\u2022 Plaid: $13B valuation\\n\\u2022 Databricks: $43B valuation\\n\\nWe're on that trajectory.\\n```\\n\\n### Minutes 20-25: Traction, Team & Ask\\n\\n**Goal:** Prove execution ability and what you need\\n\\n```\\nCurrent state:\\n[Share latest metrics - users, partnerships, revenue]\\n\\nTeam:\\n\\u2022 I'm Matt, founder and CEO\\n\\u2022 [Co-founder/CTO description if you have one]\\n\\u2022 Hiring: [key roles]\\n\\u2022 Advisors: [impressive names]\\n\\nWe're raising $[amount] to:\\n\\u2022 [Top 3 use cases for funds]\\n\\u2022 Achieve [key milestones]\\n\\u2022 Be ready for [next round] in [timeline]\\n\\nWe have $[amount] committed from [investors you can name].\\n\\nLooking to close by [date].\\n```\\n\\n### Minutes 25-30: Q&A & Next Steps\\n\\n**Goal:** Handle objections and move to next stage\\n\\n```\\nI know you'll have questions. What would be most helpful to dive into?\\n\\n[Common questions to prepare for:]\\n\\nQ: \\\"Why won't Big Tech just build this?\\\"\\nA: \\\"Conflict of interest. Their business model depends on owning user data. We're neutral and privacy-first.\\\"\\n\\nQ: \\\"What about competitors like Solid or Digi.me?\\\"\\nA: \\\"They missed the AI revolution. We're AI-native from day one. Plus, we have the tech actually working.\\\"\\n\\nQ: \\\"How do you acquire users?\\\"\\nA: \\\"B2B2C model. AI companies want this badly - they'll drive users to us. Plus direct consumer marketing.\\\"\\n\\nQ: \\\"What's your moat?\\\"\\nA: \\\"First-mover + network effects + data gravity. Once users put their data in, switching cost is massive.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo, what would be helpful for next steps? I can send over:\\n\\u2022 Full pitch deck\\n\\u2022 Financial model\\n\\u2022 Customer testimonials\\n\\u2022 Technical deep dive\\n\\nWould love to move quickly on this. Can we schedule a partner meeting for next week?\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Negotiation Tactics\\n\\n### Creating FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)\\n\\n**Strategies:**\\n1. **Scarcity:** \\\"We're only taking $7.5M and have $5M committed\\\"\\n2. **Timeline:** \\\"We're closing in 2 weeks to keep momentum\\\"\\n3. **Social proof:** \\\"Chamath is in, Reid Hoffman is doing diligence\\\"\\n4. **Competition:** \\\"We have 3 term sheets, deciding this week\\\"\\n5. **Traction updates:** Weekly emails showing growth\\n\\n**Email Example:**\\n```\\nQuick update: We crossed 1,000 users yesterday and signed our first partnership with [Company]. The round is oversubscribed - we have $8.5M committed for $7.5M target.\\n\\nI can make room for $250K if you can wire this week. After that, we're moving to our waitlist for the Series Seed.\\n\\nLet me know by EOD Friday if you want in.\\n```\\n\\n### Handling Objections\\n\\n**Objection 1: \\\"It's too early\\\"**\\n\\n**Response:**\\n> \\\"That's exactly why the return potential is 100x instead of 10x. Plaid raised their seed at this stage and returned 40x to investors. We have more built than they did at this point.\\\"\\n\\n**Objection 2: \\\"The market isn't ready\\\"**\\n\\n**Response:**\\n> \\\"I respectfully disagree. OpenAI just announced they're looking for personal data partners. Microsoft is building Copilot. Google has Gemini. The market is desperate for this - we're supply for massive existing demand.\\\"\\n\\n**Objection 3: \\\"Big Tech will crush you\\\"**\\n\\n**Response:**\\n> \\\"They can't. It's a conflict of interest with their ad/data business. Apple tried with Differential Privacy, but they can't open it up without losing control. We're the neutral third party the market needs.\\\"\\n\\n**Objection 4: \\\"How will you compete with [competitor]?\\\"**\\n\\n**Response:**\\n> \\\"Great question. [Competitor] has two problems: [Problem 1] and [Problem 2]. We solve both with [our approach]. Plus, we're moving 10x faster - we have the product built while they're still in planning.\\\"\\n\\n**Objection 5: \\\"The valuation is too high\\\"**\\n\\n**Response:**\\n> \\\"I understand. Let me share our thinking: [comparable company] raised at [valuation] with [less traction]. We have [more traction] and [strategic advantages]. That said, I'm open to discussing structure - would you prefer a lower valuation with better terms, or are you comfortable at this price with standard terms?\\\"\\n\\n**Objection 6: \\\"I need to see more traction\\\"**\\n\\n**Response:**\\n> \\\"Fair point. What metrics would make you comfortable? We can probably hit those in 60-90 days. Would you commit to leading the round if we hit [specific metric] by [date]? I'll keep you updated weekly and give you first look when we hit it.\\\"\\n\\n### Closing Tactics\\n\\n**The Direct Close:**\\n> \\\"Based on our conversation, does this sound like something you'd invest in?\\\"\\n\\n**The Assumptive Close:**\\n> \\\"Great, I'll have my lawyer send over the SAFE docs. Can you wire within 5 business days?\\\"\\n\\n**The Action Close:**\\n> \\\"What's your process for making this decision? Who else needs to be involved? When can we get a yes or no?\\\"\\n\\n**The Alternative Close:**\\n> \\\"Would you prefer to come in at $500K as a lead, or $250K as a follow-on?\\\"\\n\\n**The Puppy Dog Close:**\\n> \\\"Why don't we start with a small investment - say $100K - and you can increase it when you see our next milestone?\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Post-Meeting Follow-Up System\\n\\n### The 24-Hour Rule\\n\\n**Within 24 hours of every meeting, send:**\\n\\n1. **Thank you email** (template above)\\n2. **Meeting notes** summarizing key points\\n3. **Requested materials** (deck, model, etc.)\\n4. **Next steps** clearly defined\\n5. **Calendar invite** for follow-up (if agreed)\\n\\n### The Weekly Update Email\\n\\n**Every Friday, send to ALL investors (even those who passed):**\\n\\n```\\nSubject: Hypernet Weekly Update - Week of [Date]\\n\\nTeam,\\n\\nQuick update on our progress this week:\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udcca **Metrics:**\\n\\u2022 Users: [number] (+X% vs. last week)\\n\\u2022 API calls: [number]\\n\\u2022 Revenue: $[number] MRR\\n\\u2022 Partnerships: [status]\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude80 **Wins:**\\n\\u2022 [Biggest win of the week]\\n\\u2022 [Second win]\\n\\u2022 [Third win]\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udcf0 **In the News:**\\n\\u2022 [Any press coverage]\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udcb0 **Fundraising:**\\n\\u2022 Round status: $[X]M committed of $[Y]M target\\n\\u2022 Timeline: Closing [date]\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udcc5 **Next Week:**\\n\\u2022 [Key upcoming milestones]\\n\\nAs always, let me know if you want to discuss or if I can help with anything.\\n\\nCheers,\\nMatt\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Keeps you top of mind\\n- Shows momentum\\n- Creates FOMO for those who haven't committed\\n- Easy to forward to others\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Special Situations\\n\\n### Getting Into Y Combinator (Accelerator Strategy)\\n\\n**Why YC:**\\n- $500K standard deal ($125K for 7% equity)\\n- Network of 10,000+ founders and investors\\n- Demo Day access to 1,000+ investors\\n- Credibility boost\\n- Office hours with partners\\n\\n**Application Strategy:**\\n\\n1. **The Application:**\\n   - Video: Authentic, technical, show working product\\n   - Written: Clear problem, clear solution, why now\\n   - Idea: Emphasize \\\"picks and shovels\\\" for AI revolution\\n\\n2. **Interview Prep:**\\n   - Practice with YC founders\\n   - Know your numbers cold\\n   - Have strong vision + practical execution\\n   - Be coachable (they invest in learning ability)\\n\\n3. **During YC:**\\n   - Ship every week\\n   - Get testimonials and traction\\n   - Make connections with alumni\\n   - Prepare epic Demo Day pitch\\n\\n**Alternative Accelerators:**\\n- **Techstars** (same model as YC)\\n- **AI Grant** (free, but prestige + network)\\n- **a16z Speedrun** (new, AI-focused)\\n- **Neo** (good for first-time founders)\\n\\n### Handling Rejection\\n\\n**When an investor passes:**\\n\\n1. **Ask why:**\\n   > \\\"Thanks for considering.
