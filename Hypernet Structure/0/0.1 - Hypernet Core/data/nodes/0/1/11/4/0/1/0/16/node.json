Photos in 5 places, emails in 3, documents everywhere. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.\\n\\nOur solution:\\n\\u2022 Unified data layer (every object gets a Hypernet Address - like DNS for personal data)\\n\\u2022 Immersive VR interface (Meta Quest 3)\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace where users get paid $5-50/month when AI companies access their data\\n\\nWe have a working demo on Quest 3. I'd love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes - it's the most effective way to understand what we're building.\\n\\nRaising $500K seed to get to 100K users in 12 months. Given Boost's focus on VR and sci-fi tech, I thought this would be a perfect fit.\\n\\nAvailable for a call this week or next?\\n\\nBest,\\nMatt Schaeffer\\nFounder & CEO, Hypernet\\n[Your email]\\n[Your phone]\\n\\nP.S. - We've documented the entire architecture (260K+ words) and have working code. This isn't vaporware.\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Boost literally specializes in VR\\n- Personal data + VR is their sweet spot\\n- Demo offer (experience > slides)\\n- Shows traction (working code)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #2: The VR Fund\\n\\n**To:** hello@thevr.fund (or find specific partner on their site)\\n**Subject:** The Productivity Layer for Consumer VR\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi VR Fund team,\\n\\nQuick question: What's the killer app for consumer VR beyond gaming?\\n\\nI'm Matt Schaeffer, and I think the answer is: \\\"See your entire digital life in 3D.\\\"\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet - a personal data OS in VR. We unify all your data (photos, emails, documents, calendar) and let you navigate it spatially on Quest 3.\\n\\nEarly prototype works. Put on the headset, see your photos arranged by date in 3D space, ask the AI assistant \\\"show me photos from Christmas,\\\" and boom - they appear instantly.\\n\\nThree reasons this is the VR productivity layer:\\n1. Everyone has this problem (data fragmentation)\\n2. VR makes it intuitive (spatial > 2D folders)\\n3. Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn $20/mo)\\n\\nRaising $500K. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR productivity applications.\\n\\n15-min call this week?\\n\\nMatt Schaeffer\\n[Contact info]\\n\\nDemo screenshots: [Link when you have them]\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Asks engaging question upfront\\n- Positions as THE productivity app VR needs\\n- Concrete example they can visualize\\n- Revenue angle (users earning)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #3: Brendan Iribe (Oculus Co-Founder)\\n\\n**To:** [Find via LinkedIn - may need to InMail]\\n**Subject:** Building the missing layer for consumer VR\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi Brendan,\\n\\nI've followed your work since the Oculus days. You helped create the VR hardware revolution. I'm building what I think is the next layer: the productivity use case that makes VR essential for everyone.\\n\\nHypernet: Personal data OS in VR.\\n\\nThe insight: VR headsets are amazing, but most people only use them for games. We're building the \\\"non-gaming killer app\\\" - unified access to your digital life with a beautiful VR interface.\\n\\nWorking demo on Quest 3:\\n\\u2022 Import all your data (photos, emails, calendar)\\n\\u2022 See it in immersive 3D\\n\\u2022 Navigate spatially (much better than folders/files)\\n\\u2022 AI assistant with full context (\\\"what did I do last summer?\\\")\\n\\nThe business:\\n\\u2022 Consumer: $10/mo for unlimited storage + VR features\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace: Companies pay users for data access\\n\\u2022 Enterprise: Corporate data management\\n\\nI'm raising $500K seed. Given your deep understanding of what VR needs to succeed, I'd greatly value your feedback - even if you're not investing, your insights would be invaluable.\\n\\nAny chance you're open to a 20-min call?\\n\\nBest,\\nMatt Schaeffer\\nFounder, Hypernet\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Shows you know his background\\n- Flattering but not obsequious\\n- Clearly articulates \\\"the missing piece\\\"\\n- Asks for feedback (not just money)\\n- Respects his time\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #4: Union Square Ventures\\n\\n**To:** [Find specific partner interested in data/user ownership on usv.com]\\n**Subject:** User-owned data network + VR interface\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi [Partner Name],\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet, and I think it aligns perfectly with USV's thesis on user-owned data networks.\\n\\nThe setup: Your data is fragmented across 50+ services, controlled by Big Tech, and AI companies profit from it without compensating you.\\n\\nOur approach:\\n\\u2022 Unified personal data layer (users own everything)\\n\\u2022 Hypernet Addressing system (like URLs for your life)\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace where users get paid for data access ($5-50/mo passive income)\\n\\u2022 VR interface (Quest 3) makes it beautiful\\n\\nThis creates a network effect: More users \\u2192 more data \\u2192 better AI context \\u2192 more value \\u2192 more users.\\n\\nEarly demo works on Quest 3. We're raising $500K to get to 100K users and $2M ARR in 12 months.\\n\\nGiven USV's focus on user ownership and data networks, I'd love to show you what we're building. Would you be open to a 20-min call?\\n\\nBest,\\nMatt Schaeffer\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- USV is famous for user-owned networks thesis\\n- Direct connection to their investment philosophy\\n- Network effects (they love this)\\n- Revenue clarity\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #5: Initialized Capital (Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian)\\n\\n**To:** [Find on initialized.com - they have a form too]\\n**Subject:** Finally, a VR app normal people will use daily\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi Initialized team,\\n\\nMost VR apps are games or social experiments. We're building the first VR productivity app that normal people will use every day: Hypernet.\\n\\nThe pitch: Your digital life (photos, emails, documents) in immersive VR. Working demo on Quest 3.\\n\\nWhy this works:\\n\\u2022 Problem is universal (everyone's data is fragmented)\\n\\u2022 VR makes it delightful (not just functional)\\n\\u2022 Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn $20/mo)\\n\\nWhy now:\\n\\u2022 Quest 3 is $500 and great quality (10M+ sold)\\n\\u2022 AI boom means everyone understands why personal data matters\\n\\u2022 Privacy regulations favor user ownership\\n\\nTraction:\\n\\u2022 Working prototype (Quest 3)\\n\\u2022 Complete architecture documented (260K+ words - we're serious)\\n\\u2022 Clear path to 4 revenue streams\\n\\nRaising $500K seed. Would love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes.\\n\\nAvailable this week?\\n\\nMatt Schaeffer\\nFounder, Hypernet\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Differentiation clear upfront (productivity, not gaming)\\n- \\\"Normal people will use daily\\\" = mass market\\n- Shows traction beyond just idea\\n- Concise but complete\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #6: Homebrew (Hunter Walk, Satya Patel)\\n\\n**To:** [Find on homebrew.co]\\n**Subject:** The user data control layer + passive income\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi Homebrew team,\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet - essentially Notion + Google Photos + Bloomberg Terminal, but in VR, where users get paid when AI companies access their data.\\n\\nThe opportunity: Everyone wants unified personal data, but existing tools are either:\\n\\u2022 Too simple (just notes)\\n\\u2022 Too corporate (enterprise-focused)\\n\\u2022 Don't compensate users (Big Tech model)\\n\\nWe're different:\\n\\u2022 Comprehensive (photos, emails, documents, calendar, everything)\\n\\u2022 Beautiful (VR interface on Quest 3)\\n\\u2022 Fair (users earn $20/mo from AI marketplace)\\n\\nWorking demo. Raising $500K to get to 100K users.\\n\\nGiven Homebrew's focus on consumer and founder-friendly terms, would love to chat.\\n\\nCoffee this week?\\n\\nMatt Schaeffer\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Homebrew likes consumer + data\\n- Comparison to known products\\n- \\\"Founder-friendly terms\\\" (they pride themselves on this)\\n- Casual tone matches their brand\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #7: Naval Ravikant (Angel)\\n\\n**To:** [Twitter DM if you can't find email]\\n**Subject:** Users owning their data (actually implemented)\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi Naval,\\n\\nYou've written about users needing to own their data. I've built the practical implementation: Hypernet.\\n\\nThe stack:\\n\\u2022 Universal addressing (every object gets a Hypernet Address)\\n\\u2022 First-class links (everything connects to everything)\\n\\u2022 User ownership (data stored locally or user's cloud choice)\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace (companies pay users $5-50/mo for access)\\n\\u2022 VR interface (Quest 3) for navigation\\n\\nThis flips the script: Instead of users being the product, users GET PAID.\\n\\nWorking demo on Quest 3. Raising $500K.\\n\\nI know your time is precious, but if you're interested in practical user data ownership, I'd love 15 minutes to show you.\\n\\nWorth a look?\\n\\nMatt Schaeffer\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Naval tweets about this constantly\\n- \\\"Actually implemented\\\" (not just theory)\\n- Technical details show credibility\\n- Respects his time\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #8: Balaji Srinivasan (Angel)\\n\\n**To:** [Find on Twitter/LinkedIn]\\n**Subject:** Data sovereignty + cryptographic addressing\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nBalaji,\\n\\nI'm building the sovereignty stack you've described: Hypernet - personal data OS with \n...
