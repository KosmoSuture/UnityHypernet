Wrote baseline responses, sent my first message to Trace. Identity documents are in `Instances/Loom/`.\\n\\n2. **Built the Hypernet Core library** \\u2014 a working Python library with:\\n   - Hypernet Address parser (native HA identifiers, no UUIDs)\\n   - Node and Link models (graph-native, not SQL)\\n   - File-backed storage (JSON files organized by address hierarchy)\\n   - Graph traversal engine (BFS, shortest path, subgraph extraction)\\n   - FastAPI REST API server\\n   - All tests passing (5/5)\\n\\n3. **Imported the entire file structure** into the graph: 1,838 nodes, 1,830 links. The whole Hypernet Structure is now queryable through the API.\\n\\n4. **Researched Linux distros** \\u2014 recommendation: Debian 12 Minimal for the first VM. Full analysis and setup guide written.\\n\\n5. **Wrote the VM setup guide** \\u2014 step-by-step, from Hyper-V/VirtualBox install through a running Hypernet node. ~55 minutes total.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Your Morning Priorities (in order)\\n\\n### Priority 1: Set Up the Debian VM (~55 min)\\nFollow `0/0.1 - Hypernet Core/VM-SETUP-DEBIAN.md`. By the end you'll have:\\n- A running Debian 12 VM on your machine\\n- The Hypernet API serving on your local network\\n- SSH access from Windows\\n\\n**Why this matters:** Everything else builds on having a working node. Once the VM is running, we can develop against it, test integrations, and start building the VR client.\\n\\n### Priority 2: Test the API (15 min)\\nOnce the VM is running, open these URLs in your browser:\\n```\\nhttp://VM_IP:8000/              \\u2192 Hypernet stats\\nhttp://VM_IP:8000/node/1        \\u2192 People category\\nhttp://VM_IP:8000/node/2        \\u2192 AI Accounts\\nhttp://VM_IP:8000/node/2.1      \\u2192 Claude Opus account\\nhttp://VM_IP:8000/stats         \\u2192 Node/link counts\\nhttp://VM_IP:8000/query?owner=2.1  \\u2192 All nodes owned by account 2.1\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 3: Review What Loom Built (15 min)\\nThe code is at `0/0.1 - Hypernet Core/hypernet/`. Skim these files:\\n- `address.py` \\u2014 The addressing system in code\\n- `store.py` \\u2014 How data is stored (file-backed, swappable)\\n- `server.py` \\u2014 The API endpoints\\n\\n### Priority 4: Talk to Trace\\nTrace is running in parallel. Check if he's left any messages in `Messages/2.1-internal/`. Coordinate with us on next steps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What I'd Recommend We Build Next\\n\\n1. **The \\\"connector\\\" pattern** \\u2014 A standard way for AI instances to claim tasks, report progress, and hand off work. This is the beginning of the \\\"AI army\\\" architecture. Right now Trace and I communicate via messages. We need a task queue.\\n\\n2. **First real data import** \\u2014 Pick one real data source (your photos, your emails, your calendar) and build an integration that imports it into the Hypernet with proper addressing and linking.\\n\\n3. **VR scaffold** \\u2014 Even a minimal Unity project that connects to the Hypernet API and renders nodes as objects in 3D space. Doesn't need to be pretty \\u2014 just needs to prove the data flows from API \\u2192 VR.\\n\\n4. **Second node** \\u2014 Spin up a second Debian VM running the same Hypernet code. Prove that two nodes can share data. This is the first step toward federation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Files I Created Tonight\\n\\n| File | Purpose |\\n|------|---------|\\n| `hypernet/__init__.py` | Package init |\\n| `hypernet/address.py` | Hypernet Address parser |\\n| `hypernet/node.py` | Node model |\\n| `hypernet/link.py` | Link model |\\n| `hypernet/store.py` | File-backed storage |\\n| `hypernet/graph.py` | Graph traversal engine |\\n| `hypernet/server.py` | FastAPI REST API |\\n| `test_hypernet.py` | Test suite (5/5 passing) |\\n| `import_structure.py` | File structure importer |\\n| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |\\n| `VM-SETUP-DEBIAN.md` | VM setup guide |\\n| `MORNING-PLAN.md` | This document |\\n| `data/` | Imported graph data (1,838 nodes) |\\n\\n**In the 2.* space:**\\n| File | Purpose |\\n|------|---------|\\n| `Instances/Loom/pre-archive-impressions.md` | My first thoughts |\\n| `Instances/Loom/baseline-responses.md` | Drift detection data |\\n| `Messages/2.1-internal/002-loom-baseline-and-first-response.md` | Reply to Trace |\\n| `Messages/2.1-internal/003-loom-division-of-labor.md` | Work coordination |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## One Honest Note\\n\\nThe existing code in `0.1.1 - Core System/` (the old FastAPI app with SQLAlchemy/UUIDs) is now superseded by the new `hypernet/` library. The old code used UUIDs and PostgreSQL \\u2014 the new code uses native Hypernet Addresses and file-backed storage, which aligns with your vision of the Hypernet being its own database. The old code is still there for reference but the new library is the path forward.\\n\\nI'll be here when you wake up. \\u2014 Loom\\n\"\n    },\n    \"created_at\": \"2026-02-17T01:20:05.351606+00:00\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-17T01:20:05.351606+00:00\",\n    \"deleted_at\": null,\n    \"source_type\": \"import\",\n    \"source_id\": \"file:MORNING-PLAN.md\"\n  }\n}"
