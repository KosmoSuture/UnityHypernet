Meanwhile, AI companies are desperate for personal data to make their assistants actually useful.\\n>\\n> We're building the infrastructure that solves both problems: individuals reclaim ownership of their data, and AI companies get access to rich personal context - all with user permission and control.\\n>\\n> This is the Snowflake of personal data. The Plaid of your digital life. The data layer for the AI revolution.\\n>\\n> We have the technology built, partnerships forming, and we're raising $100M to scale this into a $5B+ company.\\\"\\n\\n**Why This Works:**\\n- Clear problem everyone understands\\n- Massive market ($4.5T)\\n- Perfect timing (AI boom + privacy concerns)\\n- Technical capability proven (we have the product)\\n- Clear business model (B2B + B2C)\\n- Defensible moats (first-mover, network effects, data gravity)\\n\\n### Must-Have #4: World-Class Advisors\\n\\n**Target Advisory Board (5-7 people):**\\n\\n1. **AI/ML Expert**\\n   -

Actually, it's 1.5 full-time jobs.**\\n\\n**Time Allocation (60-80 hours/week):**\\n\\n**Fundraising (40%):**\\n- Investor meetings: 10-15 hours/week\\n- Pitch prep and follow-up: 5-10 hours/week\\n- Networking and relationship building: 5 hours/week\\n- Materials creation: 5 hours/week\\n\\n**Product (20%):**\\n- User feedback and interviews: 5 hours/week\\n- Product decisions and roadmap: 3 hours/week\\n- Demo prep: 2 hours/week\\n- Technical discussions with CTO: 2 hours/week\\n\\n**Partnerships (20%):**\\n- Corporate dev meetings: 5 hours/week\\n- Partnership strategy: 3 hours/week\\n- Integration planning: 2 hours/week\\n\\n**Team Building (10%):**\\n- Recruiting (CTO, advisors, early hires): 5 hours/week\\n- Team meetings and management: 2 hours/week\\n\\n**Operations (10%):**\\n- Legal, finance, admin: 3 hours/week\\n- Investor updates: 2 hours/week\\n- Strategic planning: 2 hours/week\\n\\n**This will be intense. But the payoff is building a $5B+ company.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Decision Points\\n\\n### Decision 1: Bootstrap vs. Fundraise\\n\\n**Bootstrap:**\\n- Pros: Keep equity, maintain control, prove model\\n- Cons: Slow growth, miss window, can't compete with funded competitors\\n- Timeline: 18-36 months to reach $1M revenue\\n\\n**Fundraise:**\\n- Pros: Fast growth, capture market, hire talent, build moat\\n- Cons: Dilution, investor pressure, higher expectations\\n- Timeline: 12-18 months to reach $10M+ revenue\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Fundraise. The market window is NOW. AI boom won't wait.\\n\\n### Decision 2: YC vs. Direct to Angels\\n\\n**Y Combinator:**\\n- Pros: $500K + network + credibility + Demo Day\\n- Cons: 7% equity, must relocate to SF for 3 months, rigid timeline\\n- Best if: You need credibility and network\\n\\n**Direct to Angels:**\\n- Pros: Keep more equity, flexible timeline, custom terms\\n- Cons: Harder to find investors, less structure, more work\\n- Best if: You have strong network already\\n\\n**Recommendation:** If you can get 5+ warm intros to top angels, go direct. Otherwise, apply to YC as backup.\\n\\n### Decision 3: B2B vs. B2C First\\n\\n**B2B (AI companies):**\\n- Pros: Faster revenue, larger contracts, strategic partnerships\\n- Cons: Longer sales cycles, fewer customers, dependency risk\\n\\n**B2C (consumers):**\\n- Pros: Viral potential, network effects, brand value\\n- Cons: Slower monetization, higher CAC, support burden\\n\\n**Recommendation:** B2B2C - sell to AI companies who drive consumers to you. Best of both.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Bottom Line\\n\\n**Can you raise $100M in year one?**\\n\\n**Yes, if:**\\n1. You commit full-time to this (60-80 hours/week)\\n2. You hire a world-class CTO within 60-90 days\\n3. You achieve early traction (1000 users, partnerships)\\n4. You execute the fundraising playbook precisely\\n5. Market timing stays favorable (AI boom continues)\\n6. You get a few key breaks (perfect investor, viral moment, major partnership)\\n\\n**Most realistically:**\\n- You'll raise $50-75M in year one\\n- $100M+ is possible by month 18\\n- Either outcome builds a massive company\\n\\n**The opportunity is real. The technology is ready. The market is waiting.**\\n\\n**What you do in the next 90 days will determine whether this becomes a $5B company or stays a great idea.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Immediate Next Steps\\n\\n### This Week (Days 1-7):\\n\\n**Monday:**\\n- [ ] Read both strategy documents completely\\n- [ ] Decide: commit to fundraising or not\\n- [ ] If yes, clear your calendar for 90-day sprint\\n\\n**Tuesday:**\\n- [ ] Reach out to 3 potential advisors\\n- [ ] Post CTO job description (YC, LinkedIn, Twitter)\\n- [ ] Schedule coffee with 5 people who might intro you to angels\\n\\n**Wednesday:**\\n- [ ] Begin pitch deck creation\\n- [ ] List out top 50 potential angel investors\\n- [ ] Map warm intro paths using LinkedIn\\n\\n**Thursday:**\\n- [ ] Refine product roadmap for beta launch\\n- [ ] Plan user acquisition strategy\\n- [ ] Draft partnership outreach emails\\n\\n**Friday:**\\n- [ ] Set up weekly planning routine\\n- [ ] Send first batch of warm intro requests (5-10 emails)\\n- [ ] Book first investor meeting (even if it's just practice)\\n\\n### This Month (Days 1-30):\\n\\n- [ ] Close first advisor (AI expert or VC)\\n- [ ] Hire fractional CFO\\n- [ ] Create complete pitch deck\\n- [ ] Build financial model\\n- [ ] Launch beta waitlist\\n- [ ] Book 10+ angel investor meetings\\n- [ ] Make CTO offer or have 3+ strong candidates\\n\\n### This Quarter (Days 1-90):\\n\\n- [ ] Close angel round ($5-7.5M)\\n- [ ] Hire CTO and 2-3 engineers\\n- [ ] Achieve 500-1000 beta users\\n- [ ] Sign 1-2 partnership LOIs\\n- [ ] Generate $10-50K MRR\\n- [ ] Begin Seed VC outreach\\n\\n**The clock starts now.
