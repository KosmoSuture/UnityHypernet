Demo Available\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet - a personal data operating system with a VR interface for Meta Quest 3.\\n\\nThe problem: Your digital life is scattered across 50+ apps. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.\\n\\nOur solution: Unified data layer (think DNS for personal data) + immersive VR interface + AI marketplace where users get paid for data access.\\n\\nWe have a working demo on Quest 3. I'd love to put you in the headset for 10 minutes - it's the best way to understand what we're building.\\n\\nRaising $500K seed to scale to 100K users. [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out.\\n\\nAvailable for a call this week?\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Name]\\n\\nP.S. - Quick pitch deck: [Link if you have one online]\\n```\\n\\n### Template 2: Cold Outreach (Consumer/Data Investor)\\n\\n**Subject:** Users earning $20/mo from their data - interested?\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nQuick question: Do you think people should get paid when AI companies use their data?\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet - the first platform where users control their personal data and earn passive income when AI companies access it.\\n\\nIt's like if Notion, Google Photos, and Bloomberg Terminal had a baby in VR.\\n\\nEarly numbers are promising:\\n- Working prototype (Quest 3 VR demo)\\n- Complete architecture (260K+ words documented)\\n- Clear path to 4 revenue streams\\n\\nRaising $500K to get to 100K users + $2M ARR in 12 months.\\n\\n[Mutual connection] thought this might be up your alley. 15-min call?\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Name]\\n\\nDemo video: [Link]\\n```\\n\\n### Template 3: Warm Intro (Have Mutual Connection)\\n\\n**Subject:** [Mutual Friend] suggested we connect - VR + Data\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\n[Mutual Friend] suggested I reach out. I'm building Hypernet - essentially a personal OS in VR where users own their data and get paid when AI companies access it.\\n\\nWe've built a working Quest 3 demo that's pretty magical - you can see your entire digital life (photos, emails, calendar) in immersive 3D, and ask an AI assistant questions about it.\\n\\nRaising $500K seed. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR or personal data infrastructure.\\n\\nAvailable this week for a quick call?\\n\\nThanks!\\n[Your Name]\\n\\nQuick overview: [One-pager PDF if you have it]\\n```\\n\\n### Template 4: Follow-Up (No Response After 1 Week)\\n\\n**Subject:** Re: VR Personal Data OS - Demo Available\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nFollowing up on my email below. Not sure if you saw it.\\n\\nTL;DR: We're building a personal data OS in VR. Working demo. $500K raise.\\n\\nIf you're interested in VR or consumer data infrastructure, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we've built.\\n\\nIf not, no worries - happy to loop back in a few months when we have traction.\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Name]\\n```\\n\\n### Template 5: Demo Request Response\\n\\n**Subject:** Re: Demo Request\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nGreat!
