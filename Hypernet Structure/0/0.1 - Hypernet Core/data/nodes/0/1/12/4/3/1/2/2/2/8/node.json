This benefits manufacturers by:\\n\\n1. **Expanding their developer ecosystem** (lower barriers = more content)\\n2. **Growing the total VR market** (rising tide lifts all boats)\\n3. **Maintaining competitive differentiation** (hardware, features, ecosystem)\\n4. **Supporting enterprise adoption** (cross-platform = enterprise requirement)\\n5. **Future-proofing** through open standards\\n\\nWe're asking for **developer hardware** (loan or donation) and optionally technical support. In return, manufacturers get native Hypernet support and recognition as supporters of open VR development.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Documents by Use Case\\n\\n### For Understanding the Strategy:\\nStart with: **VR-Manufacturers-Contact-Strategy.md**\\n- Lists all target manufacturers (Meta, Apple, Valve, HTC, Sony, etc.)\\n- Explains how to contact each one\\n- Prioritizes targets into Tier 1, 2, 3\\n\\n### For Pitching Manufacturers:\\nUse: **Unified-VR-Platform-Pitch.md**\\n- Complete partnership proposal\\n- Explains benefits to manufacturers\\n- Addresses concerns and objections\\n- Professional pitch deck format\\n- Can be sent as PDF or used for presentations\\n\\n### For Executing Outreach:\\nFollow: **Outreach-Campaign-Plan.md**\\n- Week-by-week execution plan\\n- Email templates for different scenarios\\n- LinkedIn outreach scripts\\n- Follow-up strategies\\n- Tracking system setup\\n\\n### For Technical Discussions:\\nReference: **Technical-Requirements.md**\\n- Platform-specific hardware needs\\n- SDK and software requirements\\n- Integration timeline estimates\\n- Development environment specs\\n- Testing and QA approach\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Execute This Project\\n\\n### Week 1: Preparation\\n1.
