Think Snowflake for your digital life, or Plaid for personal data. Big Tech makes $500 billion a year selling our data - we're enabling individuals to own, control, and monetize their own data while powering the next generation of AI assistants. We have the APIs built, partnerships forming, and need capital to scale.\\\"\\n\\n**Version 2 (Corporate Strategic Focus):**\\n> \\\"Your AI products need richer personal context to deliver real value, but you can't access user data ethically or legally. We've built the missing infrastructure - a privacy-first data platform that gives AI systems access to personal data WITH user consent and control. We're talking to Salesforce, Microsoft, and Anthropic about partnerships and investment.\\\"\\n\\n**Version 3 (Grant/Policy Focus):**\\n> \\\"Data sovereignty is a human rights issue. Three companies control 80% of personal data, and individuals have no rights or compensation. We're building open infrastructure that returns data ownership to individuals while enabling responsible AI development. This aligns with GDPR, supports democratic values, and creates economic opportunity for billions of people.\\\"\\n\\n### The Problem Statement (60 seconds)\\n\\n**Current State:**\\n- You create ~2GB of data per day across 50+ platforms\\n- That data is worth $500-5000/year, but you see $0\\n- Big Tech mines it to train AI, sell ads, manipulate behavior\\n- You can't export it, combine it, or use it for YOUR benefit\\n- Even if you could, there's no infrastructure to make it useful\\n\\n**Pain Points:**\\n1. **For Individuals:** No control, no compensation, privacy invasion\\n2. **For AI Companies:** Can't access quality personal data ethically\\n3. **For Developers:** No standardized way to build personal AI apps\\n4. **For Society:** Concentration of power, surveillance capitalism\\n\\n**Why Now:**\\n- GDPR/CCPA forcing data portability\\n- AI boom creating desperate need for personal data\\n- Claude, ChatGPT proving AI assistants work - but need better context\\n- Growing consumer backlash against Big Tech\\n\\n### The Solution (60 seconds)\\n\\n**What We Built:**\\n- Universal data platform connecting 100+ sources (eventually)\\n- APIs for developers to build personal AI applications\\n- Privacy-first architecture (user owns data, grants permission)\\n- Open standards for data portability\\n\\n**How It Works:**\\n1. User connects their accounts (Google, Instagram, email, calendar, etc.)\\n2. Hypernet imports and normalizes their data\\n3. User grants permission to apps/AI services\\n4. Apps get rich personal context through our API\\n5. User maintains control, gets compensation\\n\\n**Technical Architecture:**\\n- 19 data models (Media, Emails, Tasks, Calendar, Social, etc.)\\n- REST APIs with 61 endpoints (already built)\\n- PostgreSQL + cloud storage\\n- OAuth for secure integrations\\n- On-device processing option for maximum privacy\\n\\n**Business Model:**\\n1. **B2B (Primary):** AI companies pay for API access ($0.01-0.10 per API call)\\n2. **B2C Premium:** Power users pay $10-50/month for advanced features\\n3. **Data Licensing:** Aggregated, anonymous data for research (opt-in only)\\n4. **Enterprise:** White-label for companies wanting private deployment\\n\\n### The Market Opportunity (90 seconds)\\n\\n**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**\\n- 4.5B internet users globally\\n- $1,000 average annual value per user (conservative)\\n- **$4.5 Trillion total market**\\n\\n**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**\\n- Focus: U.S. + Europe + high-income countries (1B users)\\n- Penetration: 5% in year 5\\n- **$50B annual revenue potential**\\n\\n**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):**\\n- Year 5 target: 10M users, $500M revenue\\n- **$5B company at 10x revenue multiple**\\n\\n**Market Segments:**\\n\\n| Segment | Size | Our Approach | Revenue Potential |\\n|---------|------|--------------|-------------------|\\n| **Personal AI Assistants** | Every human | B2C subscription | $50B/year |\\n| **AI Platform Companies** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | B2B API | $20B/year |\\n| **Enterprise AI** | Salesforce, Microsoft, SAP | Enterprise licensing | $30B/year |\\n| **Developers** | 25M+ developers building AI apps | API fees | $10B/year |\\n| **Data Researchers** | Universities, think tanks | Anonymous data | $5B/year |\\n\\n**Comparable Markets:**\\n- Cloud data platforms: Snowflake ($50B), Databricks ($43B)\\n- Financial data APIs: Plaid ($13B valuation), Stripe ($95B)\\n- Marketing data: LiveRamp ($10B), Segment (sold for $3.2B)\\n\\n**Why We Win:**\\n- First-mover in personal AI data infrastructure\\n- Network effects (more users = more value for developers)\\n- Data gravity (user data keeps them locked in)\\n- Impossible for Big Tech to compete (conflict of interest)\\n\\n### The Competition (60 seconds)\\n\\n**Direct Competitors (Sort Of):**\\n\\n1. **Solid (Tim Berners-Lee)** - Failed\\n   - Why: Too early, too technical, no clear use case\\n   - How we're different: AI agents are the killer app they missed\\n\\n2. **Meeco, Digi.me, Hub of All Things** - Small\\n   - Why: No developer ecosystem, no AI integration\\n   - How we're different: API-first, AI-native platform\\n\\n3. **Apple (Private Cloud Compute)** - Not competing\\n   - Why: Only for Apple users, closed ecosystem\\n   - How we're different: Platform-agnostic, open APIs\\n\\n4. **Google Takeout, Apple Data Export** - Not competing\\n   - Why: Data dumps, not infrastructure\\n   - How we're different: Live APIs, not static exports\\n\\n**Indirect Competitors:**\\n\\n5. **Big Tech building their own AI**\\n   - Why they won't do this: Conflict of interest (can't let users control data they monetize)\\n   - Our advantage: Neutral third party, privacy-first\\n\\n6. **Enterprise data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks)**\\n   - Why they won't do this: Focused on business data, not personal\\n   - Our advantage: Personal data expertise, consumer relationships\\n\\n**Competitive Moats:**\\n\\n1. **First-Mover Advantage** - Building now while market is forming\\n2. **Network Effects** - More users \\u2192 more developers \\u2192 more value\\n3. **Data Gravity** - Hard to switch once your data is in\\n4. **Strategic Partnerships** - Exclusive deals with AI companies\\n5. **Trust & Brand** - Privacy-first reputation impossible for Big Tech to replicate\\n6. **Technical Complexity** - 100+ integration points takes years to build\\n\\n### The Traction (What We Have)\\n\\n**Current State (as of Feb 2026):**\\n\\n**Product:**\\n- \\u2705 19 data models built (Media, Social, Email, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, etc.)\\n- \\u2705 61 REST API endpoints complete\\n- \\u2705 Authentication & authorization working (JWT)\\n- \\u2705 Database schema production-ready\\n- \\u2705 OpenAPI documentation auto-generated\\n- \\u23f3 User interface in development\\n- \\u23f3 First integrations being built\\n\\n**Team:**\\n- Matt Schaeffer -
