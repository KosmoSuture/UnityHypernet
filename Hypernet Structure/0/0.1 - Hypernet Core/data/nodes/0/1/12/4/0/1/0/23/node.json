Think \\\"iOS for your personal data, but in VR.\\\"\\n\\nThe problem: Your digital life is scattered across 50+ apps. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.\\n\\nOur solution:\\n\\u2022 Unified data layer (every object gets a Hypernet Address)\\n\\u2022 Immersive VR interface (see your life in 3D on Quest 3)\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace (users get paid when AI companies access their data)\\n\\nWe have a working demo. I'd love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes - it's the best way to understand what we're building.\\n\\nRaising $500K seed to scale to 100K users in 12 months. Given your focus on VR, I thought this might be up your alley.\\n\\nAvailable for a call this week?\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Title]\\n[Your Email]\\n[Your Phone]\\n\\nP.S. - Quick deck: [Link when you have it]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Email to The VR Fund\\n\\n**To:** [Find on their website - thevr.fund]\\n**Subject:** Personal OS in VR - Quest 3 Demo Available\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nQuick question: What if you could see your entire digital life in VR?\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet - essentially a personal operating system where the interface is virtual reality. Working demo on Quest 3.\\n\\nKey insight: VR needs compelling use cases beyond games and social. We're building the productivity layer - unified access to all your personal data (photos, emails, documents, calendar) with AI assistance built in.\\n\\nEarly signals are strong:\\n\\u2022 Complete architecture designed (260K+ words documented)\\n\\u2022 Working prototype (Quest 3, connects to real data)\\n\\u2022 4 revenue streams (subscription, AI marketplace, enterprise, platform fees)\\n\\nRaising $500K. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR productivity apps.\\n\\n15-min call?\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Email to Former Oculus Exec (e.g., Brendan Iribe)\\n\\n**To:** [Find on LinkedIn]\\n**Subject:** Building the missing layer for consumer VR\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nI've been following your work since the Oculus days. I'm building something I think you'd find interesting.\\n\\nHypernet: Personal data OS in VR. The thesis is that VR needs a killer app beyond gaming, and \\\"see your entire digital life in 3D\\\" could be it.\\n\\nThe product:\\n\\u2022 Import all your data (photos, emails, calendar, documents)\\n\\u2022 Navigate it spatially in Quest 3\\n\\u2022 AI assistant with full context\\n\\u2022 Users own and control everything\\n\\nThe business:\\n\\u2022 Consumer subscription ($10/mo)\\n\\u2022 AI companies pay users for data access\\n\\u2022 Enterprise data management\\n\\u2022 Developer platform\\n\\nRaising $500K seed. Given your experience building the VR industry, I'd love your feedback. Any chance you'd be open to a 20-min call?\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Name]\\n\\nDemo video: [Link]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email 11-20: Consumer/Data Investors (Priority Tier 2)\\n\\n### Email to Union Square Ventures\\n\\n**To:** [Find on USV website - usv.com]\\n**Subject:** User-owned data network in VR\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet, and I think it aligns perfectly with USV's thesis on user-owned data networks.\\n\\nThe problem: Your data is fragmented (50+ apps), controlled by Big Tech, and AI companies profit from it without compensating you.\\n\\nOur solution: Unified personal data layer where:\\n1. You own and control everything\\n2. AI companies pay YOU for access ($5-50/month passive income)\\n3. VR interface makes it magical (Quest 3)\\n\\nThis creates a network effect: More users \\u2192 more data \\u2192 better AI context \\u2192 more users want in.\\n\\nWe have a working Quest 3 demo. Raising $500K seed to get to 100K users and $2M ARR in 12 months.\\n\\nGiven USV's focus on user ownership and data networks, I'd love to show you what we're building. 20-min call?\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n[Contact info]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Email to Initialized Capital\\n\\n**To:** [Find on initialized.com]\\n**Subject:** VR + Personal Data = $2T Market\\n\\n```\\nHi [Name],\\n\\nQuick pitch: We're building Hypernet - think Notion meets Google Photos meets Bloomberg Terminal, but in VR.\\n\\nThe insight: Everyone wants unified personal data, but 2D interfaces suck for it. VR makes it intuitive and beautiful.\\n\\nWorking demo:\\n\\u2022 Put on Quest 3\\n\\u2022 See your photos, emails, calendar in immersive 3D\\n\\u2022 Ask AI: \\\"Show me photos from our vacation last summer\\\"\\n\\u2022 It instantly shows them, plus the emails about planning it, plus the calendar events\\n\\nTraction:\\n\\u2022 Complete architecture (fully documented)\\n\\u2022 Working prototype (Quest 3)\\n\\u2022 Clear path to 4 revenue streams\\n\\nRaising $500K.

We're building the productivity layer: Hypernet, a personal data OS in VR.\\n\\nWhy it works:\\n\\u2022 Everyone has this problem (data fragmentation)\\n\\u2022 VR makes it delightful (not just functional)\\n\\u2022 Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn passive income)\\n\\nWhy now:\\n\\u2022 Quest 3 = $500, great quality, millions sold\\n\\u2022 AI boom = desperate need for personal context data\\n\\u2022 Privacy regs = users want control\\n\\nWe have a working Quest 3 demo. It's pretty magical.\\n\\nRaising $500K to get to 100K users.

I'm building the practical implementation: Hypernet.\\n\\nThe pitch:\\n\\u2022 Unified personal data layer (everything has a Hypernet Address)\\n\\u2022 VR interface (Quest 3) for navigation\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace: Companies pay users $5-50/mo for data access\\n\\nThis flips the script: Instead of users being the product, users GET PAID.\\n\\nEarly prototype is working. Raising $500K to scale.\\n\\nI know your time is limited, but if you're interested in user data ownership, I'd love 15 minutes to show you the demo.\\n\\nWorth a look?\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Email to Balaji Srinivasan\\n\\n**To:** [Twitter DM or email]\\n**Subject:** Data sovereignty in VR\\n\\n```\\nBalaji,\\n\\nBig fan of your work on data sovereignty.
