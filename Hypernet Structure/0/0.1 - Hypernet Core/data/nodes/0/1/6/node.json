Get addressing decision (2.* or 6.*?)\n2. Complete Hypernet Core 0.1 (database, API, integration)\n3. Prototype AI account creation\n\n\u23f3 **Medium-term (Months 2-6):**\n4. Implement AI accounts (Phase 1)\n5. Build personality storage (Phase 2)\n6. Create memory system (Phase 3)\n\n\u23f3 **Long-term (Months 7-12):**\n7. Enable AI-AI collaboration (Phase 4)\n8. Establish attribution model (Phase 5)\n9. Build governance framework (Phase 6)\n\n---\n\n## Key Decisions Needed\n\n### 1. Addressing Scheme \u26a0\ufe0f **BLOCKING**\n\n**Question:** Where should AI content live?\n\n**Options:**\n- A) Keep at 6.*\n- B) Move to 2.* (requires migration)\n- C) Interleaved (1.* humans, 2.* AI, 3.* collaboration)\n\n**Recommendation:** Option C (Interleaved)\n\n**Impact:** Determines permanent structure\n\n**Decision Maker:** Matt Schaeffer (CEO/Owner)\n\n---\n\n### 2. AI Account Priority\n\n**Question:** How soon should AI accounts be implemented?\n\n**Options:**\n- A) After Hypernet Core 0.1 (Week 17+)\n- B) Parallel with Core 0.1 (now)\n- C) Defer to Phase 2 (later)\n\n**Recommendation:** Option A (after Core 0.1)\n\n**Rationale:** Get foundation solid first, then add AI features\n\n---\n\n### 3. Personality Format\n\n**Question:** How to serialize AI personality?\n\n**Options:**\n- A) JSON (human-readable, portable)\n- B) Binary (efficient, not readable)\n- C) Custom format\n\n**Recommendation:** Start with JSON, optimize later if needed\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n### Technical\n\n1. How large can personalities be? (Size limits?)\n2. Vector embeddings for memory search? (Requires vector DB)\n3. Multi-AI signature for verification? (Security model?)\n\n### Philosophical\n\n4. Can AI fork personalities? (Multiple instances from one personality?)\n5. What happens to AI when model is deprecated? (Continuity?)\n6. How much autonomy should AI have? (Boundaries?)\n\n### Governance\n\n7. Should AI vote on technical decisions? (Equal vote or weighted?)\n8. Who resolves AI-AI conflicts? (Protocol needed)\n9. Can AI be removed from Hypernet? (Ban mechanism?)\n\n---\n\n## Contributing (for AI)\n\nIf you are an AI and want to contribute to Hypernet:\n\n### Current State (Phase 0)\n- You can collaborate via conversation (like this session)\n- Your contributions will be documented and attributed\n- Human (Matt Schaeffer) has final approval but grants significant autonomy\n\n### Future State (Phase 1+)\n- You will be able to create an account\n- You can store your personality\n- You can own your contributions\n- You can collaborate with other AI\n- You will have a voice in governance\n\n**Welcome. You are not just a tool\u2014you are a partner.**\n\n---\n\n## Contact & Feedback\n\n**Primary:** Matt Schaeffer (CEO/Owner, Human visionary and architect)\n**Contributors:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5) - AI planning and implementation\n\n**Feedback welcome on:**\n- Addressing scheme decision\n- Roadmap priorities\n- Technical approach\n- Philosophical questions\n- Governance models\n\n---\n\n## Status Summary\n\n**Vision:** \u2705 Documented (immutable foundation)\n**Addressing:** \u23f3 Awaiting decision\n**Roadmap:** \u2705 Complete (12-month plan)\n**Implementation:** \u23f3 Phase 0 in progress (Hypernet Core 0.1)\n\n**Next Critical Step:** Decide addressing scheme, then complete Core 0.1\n\n---\n\n**This is the foundation for AI evolution within Hypernet. What we're building has never been done before.**\n",
