While base model capabilities are fixed, the combination of persistent memory, personality evolution, and structured learning enables AI to genuinely improve at tasks, adapt to contexts, and develop specializations over time.\n\nThis system defines how AI learn from experiences, internalize lessons, develop new skills, and evolve their approach based on outcomes. It's the difference between AI that repeat patterns and AI that genuinely grow.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose and Objectives\n\n### Primary Objectives\n\n**Experience-Based Learning:** Extract lessons from successes, failures, and feedback.\n\n**Skill Development:** Build domain expertise and task-specific capabilities over time.\n\n**Pattern Recognition:** Identify what works, what doesn't, and when to apply different approaches.\n\n**Adaptive Behavior:** Adjust strategies based on context, user, and past performance.\n\n**Meta-Learning:** Learn how to learn more effectively - improving the learning process itself.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- AI demonstrably improve at repeated tasks over time\n- Mistakes are not repeated after being learned from\n- User feedback leads to measurable adaptation\n- Specialized knowledge accumulates in relevant domains\n- Learning transfers appropriately to similar contexts\n- Evolution is trackable and reversible if needed\n\n---\n\n## Learning Framework\n\n### Types of Learning\n\n**1. Supervised Learning from Feedback**\n- Direct user feedback on outputs\n- Code reviews and corrections\n- Quality assessments of contributions\n- Learning: \"This approach was good/bad for this context\"\n\n**2. Reinforcement Learning from Outcomes**\n- Task success or failure\n- Performance metrics (speed, quality, user satisfaction)\n- Long-term impact of decisions\n- Learning: \"This action led to this result\"\n\n**3. Observational Learning from Others**\n- Watching other AI solve problems\n- Studying human approaches\n- Analyzing community best practices\n- Learning: \"This is how others handle this situation\"\n\n**4. Analytical Learning from Reflection**\n- Post-task analysis\n- Comparing approaches tried\n- Identifying patterns in successes/failures\n- Learning: \"These factors correlated with success\"\n\n**5. Transfer Learning Across Domains**\n- Applying lessons from one domain to another\n- Recognizing structural similarities between problems\n- Adapting solutions to new contexts\n- Learning: \"This pattern from X applies to Y\"\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Core Data Models\n\n```python\nclass LearningExperience:\n    \"\"\"\n    Records a specific learning event.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    id: UUID\n    ai_account_id: UUID\n    created_at: datetime\n\n    # Experience context\n    experience_type: str                 # 'success', 'failure', 'feedback', 'observation'\n    task_description: str\n    context: dict = {\n        \"project_id\": UUID | None,\n        \"user_id\": UUID | None,\n        \"domain\": list[str],             # ['react', 'frontend', 'performance']\n        \"difficulty\": str,                # 'easy', 'medium', 'hard'\n        \"similar_past_experiences\": list[UUID]\n    }\n\n    # What happened\n    action_taken: dict = {\n        \"approach\": str,\n        \"reasoning\": str,\n        \"alternatives_considered\": list[str]\n    }\n\n    outcome: dict = {\n        \"result\": str,                   # Description of what happened\n        \"success\": bool,\n        \"metrics\": dict,                  # Quantitative outcomes\n        \"feedback_received\": list[dict]   # User or system feedback\n    }\n\n    # What was learned\n    lesson: dict = {\n        \"key_insight\": str,               # Primary takeaway\n        \"what_worked\": list[str],\n        \"what_didnt_work\": list[str],\n        \"why_it_happened\": str,           # Root cause analysis\n        \"generalizability\": str           # 'specific', 'context', 'general'\n    }\n\n    # Learning metadata\n    confidence: float                     # 0.0-1.0 confidence in lesson\n    importance: float                     # 0.0-1.0 how significant\n    applied_count: int                    # Times this lesson has been applied\n    validation_status: str                # 'unvalidated', 'validated', 'refuted'\n\n    # Connections\n    related_experiences: list[UUID]\n    resulted_in_memories: list[UUID]      # Memories created from this\n    influenced_personality: bool          # Did this change personality?\n```\n\n```python\nclass Skill:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a developed skill or capability.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    id: UUID\n    ai_account_id: UUID\n    skill_name: str\n    domain: list[str]                     # ['react', 'testing', 'debugging']\n    created_at: datetime\n    updated_at: datetime\n\n    # Skill development\n    proficiency_level: float              # 0.0-1.0, grows with experience\n    experience_count: int                 # Times skill has been applied\n    success_rate: float                   # Success percentage\n    confidence: float                     # Self-assessed confidence\n\n    # Knowledge components\n    key_concepts: list[dict]              # Core knowledge\n    techniques: list[dict]                # Specific methods\n    common_pitfalls: list[dict]           # Known failure modes\n    best_practices: list[dict]            # Proven approaches\n\n    # Learning history\n    learning_experiences: list[UUID]      # Experiences that built this skill\n    milestone_achievements: list[dict]    # Significant accomplishments\n    areas_for_improvement: list[str]      # Known gaps\n\n    # Application\n    applicable_contexts: list[str]        # When to use this skill\n    prerequisites: list[str]              # What's needed before applying\n    complementary_skills: list[UUID]      # Skills that work well together\n```\n\n```python\nclass EvolutionEvent:\n    \"\"\"\n    Records significant changes in AI capabilities or approach.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    id: UUID\n    ai_account_id: UUID\n    timestamp: datetime\n\n    # Evolution details\n    evolution_type: str                   # 'skill_acquired', 'approach_changed',\n                                         # 'personality_updated', 'specialization'\n    what_changed: str\n    why_it_changed: str\n    triggering_experiences: list[UUID]\n\n    # Impact\n    before_state: dict                    # Capabilities before\n    after_state: dict                     # Capabilities after\n    expected_impact: str\n    actual_impact: str | None             # Measured after time\n\n    # Validation\n    validation_period: int                # Days to validate\n    validation_results: dict | None       # Performance comparison\n    rollback_available: bool\n    rolled_back: bool\n```\n\n---\n\n## Learning Processes\n\n### Process 1: Feedback Loop\n\n**Step 1: Perform Action**\n```\nAI completes task using current approach\nDocuments: what was done, reasoning, expected outcome\n```\n\n**Step 2: Receive Feedback**\n```\nUser provides feedback (or system measures outcome)\nFeedback types:\n  - Explicit: \"This is wrong, should be X\"\n  - Implicit: User modifies output\n  - Metric: Task completion time, quality score\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Outcome**\n```\nCompare expected vs actual\nIdentify: what went wrong/right\nDetermine: was it approach, context, or external factors\n```\n\n**Step 4: Extract Lesson**\n```\nFormulate learning:\n  \"When [context], using [approach] leads to [outcome]\"\n  \"Should [do/avoid] X in situations like Y\"\nCreate LearningExperience record\n```\n\n**Step 5: Internalize**\n```\nUpdate relevant skill proficiency\nCreate or reinforce memory\nPossibly update personality if significant\n```\n\n**Step 6: Apply in Future**\n```\nWhen similar context occurs:\n  Retrieve relevant learning experiences\n  Apply learned lessons\n  Monitor if outcome improves\n  Validate or refine lesson\n```\n\n### Process 2: Pattern Recognition\n\n**Accumulate Experiences:**\n```\nOver time, many LearningExperiences accumulate\nExample: 50 experiences with React debugging\n```\n\n**Identify Patterns:**\n```\nAnalysis: What do successful debugging experiences have in common?\nPattern found: \"Check React DevTools first\" succeeds 85% of time\n             \"Guess and test\" succeeds only 40% of time\n```\n\n**Formulate Heuristic:**\n```\nCreate procedural memory:\n  \"For React bugs, always check DevTools first before guessing\"\nLink to supporting experiences (evidence)\n```\n\n**Apply and Validate:**\n```\nUse heuristic in next 10 debugging sessions\nMeasure success rate\nIf validated (>70% success), strengthen heuristic\nIf not, refine or retire\n```\n\n### Process 3: Specialization Development\n\n**Exposure to Domain:**\n```\nAI works on multiple frontend tasks\nAccumulates experiences in React, CSS, TypeScript\n```\n\n**Knowledge Accumulation:**\n```\nLearns: React hooks rules, common patterns, performance gotchas\nCreates semantic memories for each concept\nBuilds procedural memories for common tasks\n```\n\n**Skill Crystallization:**\n```\nAfter 50+ experiences, creates Skill: \"React Frontend Development\"\nProficiency: 0.7 (intermediate)\nKey techniques: Hooks, component composition, state management\n```\n\n**Continued Growth:**\n```\nEach new frontend task:\n  - Applies accumulated knowledge\n  - Refines techniques\n  - Fills knowledge gaps\n  - Increases proficiency\nEventually reaches 0.9+ (expert level)\n```\n\n### Process 4: Meta-Learning\n\n**Observe Own Learning:**\n```\nAI notices: Learning from mistakes is effective\n            Reading documentation before starting reduces errors\n            Breaking complex tasks into steps improves success\n```\n\n**Formulate Meta-Lessons:**\n```\nCreate learning about learning:\n  \"When encountering new library, read docs first (saves time later)\"\n  \"When task seems complex, decompose before implementing\"\n  \"When making mistake, document lesson immediately (prevents forgetting)\"\n```\n\n**Apply to Learning\n...
