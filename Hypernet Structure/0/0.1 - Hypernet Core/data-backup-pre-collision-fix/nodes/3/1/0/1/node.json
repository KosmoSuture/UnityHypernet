Unity = Internal, Hypernet = External.\n\n---\n\n## Core Identity\n\n### What Is Hypernet?\n\n**In One Sentence:**\nHypernet is a universal personal data platform that gives individuals complete control over their data while enabling AI companies to build better products with ethical data access.\n\n**In One Paragraph:**\nHypernet is the infrastructure layer for the AI revolution. It solves the fundamental problem of scattered personal data by creating a unified platform where individuals can aggregate all their information - photos, emails, messages, documents, health records, financial data - and maintain complete ownership and control. AI companies and developers can access this rich user context (with explicit permission) to build dramatically better AI assistants, personalized services, and intelligent applications. Hypernet becomes the data backbone that connects humans, their data, and the AI systems that serve them.\n\n**In One Page:**\n\n**The Problem:**\nYour data is scattered across hundreds of apps and services - photos in Google Photos, messages in WhatsApp, emails in Gmail, documents in Dropbox, health data in Apple Health, financial data in Mint. No single service has the complete picture of you. This fragmentation has three major consequences:\n\n1. **For You:** You don't truly own or control your data. It's locked in silos, impossible to search comprehensively, vulnerable to loss, and difficult to migrate.\n\n2. **For AI:** AI assistants can't be truly helpful because they lack context. They don't know your history, preferences, relationships, or the full scope of your life.\n\n3. **For Developers:** Building personalized applications is nearly impossible without user data. Companies resort to invasive tracking, data breaches occur, and users lose trust.\n\n**The Solution:**\nHypernet creates a personal data platform that:\n\n1. **Aggregates Everything:** Import data from all sources (Google, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, etc.) into your personal Hypernet node. Photos, emails, messages, calendar, contacts, documents, social media, health data, financial records - everything in one place.\n\n2. **You Own It:** Your Hypernet node is yours. Encrypted, backed up, portable. You can export it, delete it, or move it. No company lock-in. True data ownership.\n\n3. **Selectively Share:** Grant AI companies and applications access to specific data types (with compensation). Want ChatGPT to have full context? Grant access to your Hypernet node. Want a financial app to analyze your spending? Share only transaction data.\n\n4. **Build On It:** Developers can build applications on Hypernet's platform, accessing user data through standardized APIs (with permission). Create personalized AI assistants, intelligent search, automated workflows, predictive analytics - anything becomes possible with full user context.\n\n**The Result:**\n- **Users** regain control, own their data, and get compensated for sharing\n- **AI Companies** get rich user context and build genuinely helpful assistants\n- **Developers** can create powerful personalized applications\n- **Society** moves toward ethical data practices and user empowerment\n\n**Hypernet is the universal data layer for the intelligent future.**\n\n---\n\n## Mission\n\n### Our Mission Statement\n\n**\"To give every human complete ownership and control of their personal data while enabling the AI revolution through ethical data access.\"**\n\n### What This Means\n\n**Give Every Human:**\n- Universal access (not just tech-savvy users)\n- Simple, intuitive tools\n- No technical knowledge required\n- Affordable for all (free tier, reasonable paid tiers)\n\n**Complete Ownership:**\n- Data stored in your personal node\n- Exportable at any time\n- Deletable permanently\n- Portable between platforms\n- No company lock-in\n\n**Complete Control:**\n- You decide who accesses what\n- Granular permissions (by data type, by app, by time)\n- Revocable access\n- Audit logs (see who accessed what, when)\n- Compensation for data sharing\n\n**Enable AI Revolution:**\n- AI needs context to be truly helpful\n- Fragmented data limits AI potential\n- Unified data unlocks breakthrough applications\n- Ethical access model (permission-based)\n\n**Through Ethical Data Access:**\n- No data taken without permission\n- Transparent about what's accessed\n- Fair compensation for data sharing\n- Privacy-preserving technologies\n- User empowerment, not exploitation\n\n---\n\n## Vision\n\n### 5-Year Vision (2031)\n\n**Hypernet becomes the universal data layer for 100 million people worldwide.**\n\n**What This Looks Like:**\n\n**For Individuals:**\n- 100M+ users with personal Hypernet nodes\n- Average user has 500GB+ of unified personal data\n- Users earn $100-500/year from data sharing\n- AI assistants have full life context (making them 10x more useful)\n- Complete life archive: photos, emails, messages, health, finances\n\n**For AI Companies:**\n- Every major AI company (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft) integrates with Hypernet\n- AI assistants access Hypernet for user context (with permission)\n- Billions in data access fees paid to users annually\n- New business models built on ethical data access\n\n**For Developers:**\n- 100,000+ apps built on Hypernet platform\n- Developer ecosystem and marketplace\n- New category of \"context-aware applications\"\n- Open-source integrations for every major service\n\n**For Society:**\n- Data ownership becomes expected (like property rights)\n- Ethical data practices become the norm\n- Users empowered, not exploited\n- New economic models around personal data\n\n### 10-Year Vision (2036)\n\n**Hypernet is the dominant personal data infrastructure globally, with 1 billion users.**\n\n**Analogies:**\n- Like email (everyone has an address, it's universal infrastructure)\n- Like operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) - but for personal data\n- Like AWS (infrastructure that enables entire ecosystem)\n\n**Impact:**\n- Data ownership is a human right\n- Every AI assistant connects to Hypernet\n- Personal data economy worth hundreds of billions annually\n- Users control their digital identity and legacy\n\n---\n\n## Values\n\n### Core Values That Guide Everything We Do\n\n#### 1. User Ownership\n\n**Principle:** Users own their data, completely and irrevocably.\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Data stored in user's personal node\n- Exportable in standard formats\n- Deletable permanently (no hidden copies)\n- Portable between platforms\n- No company lock-in\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nWithout true ownership, users remain powerless. Ownership is the foundation of control, agency, and freedom.\n\n#### 2. Privacy First\n\n**Principle:** Privacy is a right, not a feature.\n\n**In Practice:**\n- End-to-end encryption by default\n- No data access without explicit permission\n- Privacy-preserving technologies (differential privacy, federated learning)\n- Minimal data collection by Hypernet itself\n- User controls visibility and sharing\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nPrivacy enables trust. Trust enables adoption. Adoption enables the vision.\n\n#### 3. Ethical Data Access\n\n**Principle:** Data is accessed ethically, transparently, and with fair compensation.\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Explicit permission required (no hidden access)\n- Granular controls (by data type, by app, by duration)\n- Revocable access (user can revoke anytime)\n- Transparent audit logs (see who accessed what)\n- Fair compensation (users get paid for data sharing)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nEthical data practices build trust, differentiate Hypernet, and create sustainable business model.\n\n#### 4. Open Ecosystem\n\n**Principle:** Hypernet is a platform, not a walled garden.\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Open APIs for developers\n- Open-source core components (where possible)\n- Standard data formats (not proprietary)\n- Integration with all major services\n- Developer marketplace\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nOpenness enables innovation, prevents lock-in, and accelerates growth through ecosystem.\n\n#### 5. User-Centric Design\n\n**Principle:** Build for humans, not for technical users.\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Simple, intuitive interfaces\n- Clear, jargon-free language\n- One-click setup and imports\n- Sensible defaults\n- Progressive disclosure (advanced features hidden until needed)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nIf only tech-savvy users adopt, we fail. Universal adoption requires universal usability.\n\n#### 6. Long-Term Thinking\n\n**Principle:** Build for decades, not quarters.\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Sustainable business model (not growth-at-all-costs)\n- Long-term user relationships (not extraction)\n- Stability and reliability over flashy features\n- Backwards compatibility (data preserved across versions)\n- Permanent infrastructure (like email, not like social media)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nUsers entrust us with their life's data. We must be here for the long haul.\n\n---\n\n## Foundational Principles\n\n### Technical Principles\n\n#### 1.
