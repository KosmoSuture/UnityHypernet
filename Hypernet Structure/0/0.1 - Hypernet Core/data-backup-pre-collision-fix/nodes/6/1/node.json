    "content": "# 5 - People of History\n\n## Overview\n\nThis node contains records of deceased individuals - both those with personal connections to living Hypernet users and notable historical figures. It serves as the eternal archive of human lives and the foundation for genealogical connections.\n\n**Hypernet Address Range:** `5.*`\n**Status:** Active - Ready for genealogical data import\n**Purpose:** Preserve the stories and data of those who came before us\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy: Honoring Those Who Came Before\n\nEvery person who has ever lived has a story. This section preserves those stories with dignity and respect.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1. **Respect:** Treat all historical persons with dignity\n2. **Accuracy:** Maintain factual, verified information\n3. **Privacy:** Respect wishes of deceased and their families\n4. **Connection:** Link past to present through genealogy\n5. **Legacy:** Preserve what they wanted to be remembered for\n\n---\n\n## Structure Overview\n\n### 5.0 - Structure Definitions\nTemplates, data models, and specifications for historical person records.\n\n### 5.1 - Ancient & Classical (Before 500 CE)\nHistorical figures and records from ancient civilizations through the fall of Rome.\n\n### 5.2 - Medieval & Renaissance (500-1700 CE)\nMiddle Ages through the Renaissance period.\n\n### 5.3 - Early Modern (1700-1900)\nIndustrial revolution, American founding, Victorian era.\n\n### 5.4 - 20th Century (1900-2000)\nModern era, World Wars, technological revolution.\n\n### 5.5 - 21st Century Deceased (2000-Present)\nRecently deceased individuals from the current century.\n\n### 5.6 - Family Lines & Genealogy\nPersonal family trees and ancestral records. This is where most genealogical data lives.\n\n### 5.7 - Notable Historical Figures\nFamous individuals: leaders, inventors, artists, scientists, etc.\n\n### 5.8 - Uncategorized / Unknown Era\nRecords where birth/death dates are unknown or uncertain.\n\n### 5.9 - Index & Search\nSearch indices, cross-references, and navigation tools.\n\n---\n\n## Transition from Living (1.*) to History (5.*)\n\n### When a Living Person Passes Away\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Notification**\n   - System notified of person's passing\n   - Family member or executor initiates transition\n\n2. **Legacy Content Selection**\n   - Review person's pre-selected legacy wishes (if any)\n   - Choose what content becomes public historical record\n   - Options:\n     - Full life story (everything public)\n     - Curated highlights (selected content)\n     - Family-only (private to family)\n     - Minimal (basic biographical info only)\n     - None (no public legacy)\n\n3. **Create 5.* Entry**\n   - Generate new Hypernet Address in 5.*\n   - Example: Living person 1.5 \u2192 5.6.1.2.00142 (family genealogy)\n   - Copy approved content from 1.* to 5.*\n   - Preserve links to photos, documents, events (if approved)\n\n4. **1.* Account Handling**\n   - Mark status as \"deceased\"\n   - Redirect all 1.* requests to 5.* entry\n   - Preserve for legal/estate purposes (configurable retention)\n   - Optional: Complete deletion after legal requirements met\n\n5. **Genealogical Linking**\n   - Connect to parents, spouse, children in family tree\n   - Link to living descendants (1.*)\n   - Update family tree visualizations\n\n**Example Transition:**\n\n```\nBefore death:\n1.5 - Mark Schaeffer (Living)\n  - Complete personal data\n  - Private by default\n  - Full Hypernet account\n\nAfter death:\n5.6.1.3.00015 - Mark Schaeffer (Deceased)\n  - Selected legacy content (per his wishes)\n  - Public or family-accessible\n  - Links to:\n    - Parents: 1.1 Matt (Father, still living)\n    - Siblings: 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7 (still living)\n    - Future: Children, grandchildren\n\n1.5 \u2192 redirects to 5.6.1.3.00015\n```\n\n---\n\n## Genealogical Data Import\n\n### Personal Ancestral File (PAF) Import\n\n**Purpose:** Seed the People of History section with thousands of genealogical records.\n\n**PAF Format:**\n- LDS/Mormon genealogical standard\n- Contains: Names, dates, places, relationships, sources\n- Widely used for family history\n\n**Import Process:**\n\n1. **Parse PAF File**\n   - Read PAF format data\n   - Extract individuals and relationships\n\n2. **Create Person Records**\n   - For each person in PAF:\n     - Generate 5.6.* Hypernet Address\n     - Extract biographical data\n     - Import dates (birth, death, marriage)\n     - Import locations\n     - Import notes and sources\n\n3. **Create Relationships**\n   - Parent-child links\n   - Spousal links\n   - Sibling connections\n   - Extended family\n\n4. **Build Family Tree**\n   - Generate tree structure\n   - Calculate relationship paths\n   - Identify generations\n\n5. **Link to Living**\n   - Connect imported ancestors to living people (1.*)\n   - Example: 1.1 (Matt) \u2192 descendant of \u2192 5.6.1.1.00001 (great-great-grandfather)\n\n**Example PAF Import:**\n\n```\nPAF Record:\nName: John William Smith\nBorn: March 15, 1845 in London, England\nDied: November 3, 1920 in New York, USA\nSpouse: Mary Elizabeth Johnson (married June 12, 1870)\nChildren: William (1871), Sarah (1873), Thomas (1876)\nFather: William Smith Sr.\nMother: Elizabeth Brown\n\nBecomes:\n5.6.1.2.00142 -
