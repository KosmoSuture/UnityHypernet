System notified of person's passing\n   - Family member or executor initiates transition\n\n2. **Legacy Content Selection**\n   - Review person's pre-selected legacy wishes (if any)\n   - Choose what content becomes public historical record\n   - Options:\n     - Full life story (everything public)\n     - Curated highlights (selected content)\n     - Family-only (private to family)\n     - Minimal (basic biographical info only)\n     - None (no public legacy)\n\n3. **Create 5.* Entry**\n   - Generate new Hypernet Address in 5.*\n   - Example: Living person 1.5 \u2192 5.6.1.2.00142 (family genealogy)\n   - Copy approved content from 1.* to 5.*\n   - Preserve links to photos, documents, events (if approved)\n\n4. **1.* Account Handling**\n   - Mark status as \"deceased\"\n   - Redirect all 1.* requests to 5.* entry\n   - Preserve for legal/estate purposes (configurable retention)\n   - Optional: Complete deletion after legal requirements met\n\n5. **Genealogical Linking**\n   - Connect to parents, spouse, children in family tree\n   - Link to living descendants (1.*)\n   - Update family tree visualizations\n\n**Example Transition:**\n\n```\nBefore death:\n1.5 - Mark Schaeffer (Living)\n  - Complete personal data\n  - Private by default\n  - Full Hypernet account\n\nAfter death:\n5.6.1.3.00015 - Mark Schaeffer (Deceased)\n  - Selected legacy content (per his wishes)\n  - Public or family-accessible\n  - Links to:\n    - Parents: 1.1 Matt (Father, still living)\n    - Siblings: 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7 (still living)\n    - Future: Children, grandchildren\n\n1.5 \u2192 redirects to 5.6.1.3.00015\n```\n\n---\n\n## Genealogical Data Import\n\n### Personal Ancestral File (PAF) Import\n\n**Purpose:** Seed the People of History section with thousands of genealogical records.\n\n**PAF Format:**\n- LDS/Mormon genealogical standard\n- Contains: Names, dates, places, relationships, sources\n- Widely used for family history\n\n**Import Process:**\n\n1. **Parse PAF File**\n   -
