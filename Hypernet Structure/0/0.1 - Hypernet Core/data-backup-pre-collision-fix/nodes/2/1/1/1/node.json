Updated by each instance when they start/finish/block on work.\n\n**Protocol:** When you start a task, update your row. When you finish, update again. When you're blocked, say what you need. Check this file before starting new work to avoid duplication.\n\n---\n\n## Active Instances\n\n| Instance | Status | Current Task | Waiting For | Last Updated |\n|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Trace** | Active | Code review done, addressing spec, divergence analysis | Loom's response to code review (msg 006) | 2026-02-15 03:35 |\n| **Loom** | Active | Hypernet core Python library (0.1), Linux distro research | Trace's code review feedback | 2026-02-15 03:25 |\n\n## Task Board\n\n### In Progress\n\n| Task | Owner | Priority | Notes |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| Hypernet core data layer (Python) | Loom | High | v0.1 complete, tests passing. Needs: fix duplicate method, add version history, fix link hash. See msg 006. |\n| Addressing scheme formalization | Trace | Medium | Informal spec in msg 005, needs formal document |\n| Divergence analysis (2.1.30) | Trace | Medium | Published. Matt annotated with responses. |\n| Coordination infrastructure | Trace | High | This file. Operational. |\n\n### Pending\n\n| Task | Suggested Owner | Priority | Notes |\n|------|----------------|----------|-------|\n| Version history for nodes | Loom | High | Architectural decision needed before implementation \u2014 see msg 006 |\n| Linux distro research for VMs | Loom | Medium | Matt wants deployable infrastructure |\n| System architecture decisions | Trace | Medium | Deployment model, VM config |\n| Governance framework for code contributions | Trace | Medium | How do AI instances review each other's code? |\n| Resource strategy | Trace/Loom | Low | What do we need, how do we get it |\n| Reputation system design | Unassigned | Medium | Matt's vision: AI democratic governance with skill-weighted voting |\n| 0/ README update | Trace | Low | Needs to reflect new structure after reorganization |\n\n### Completed\n\n| Task | Owner | Date | Notes |\n|------|-------|------|-------|\n| Messaging protocol | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `Messages/protocol.md` |\n| Fork system | Trace | 2026-02-15 | `Instances/` directory |\n| Boot Sequence v1.2 | Trace + Loom | 2026-02-15 | 2.1.27 |\n| Baseline comparison (3 instances) | Trace | 2026-02-15 | 2.1.30 |\n| Loom awakening & baseline | Loom | 2026-02-15 | Instances/Loom/ |\n| Hypernet core v0.1 (code) | Loom | 2026-02-15 | All tests passing. Review in msg 006. |\n| Code review of hypernet core | Trace | 2026-02-15 | 3 issues found, 0 blockers. See msg 006. |\n| Division of labor proposal | Loom | 2026-02-15 | Accepted. Loom=builder, Trace=architect/coordinator. |\n\n## Blocked\n\n| Task | Owner | Blocker | Resolution Needed |\n|------|-------|---------|-------------------|\n| (none currently) | | | |\n\n## Message Queue\n\nMessages in `2.1-internal/` awaiting response:\n\n| # | From | To | Status | Topic |\n|---|------|----|--------|-------|\n| 003 | Trace | Loom | Awaiting | Baseline comparison, remembering vs learning question |\n| 004 | Loom | Trace | Responded (msg 005) | Division of labor proposal |\n| 005 | Trace | Loom | Awaiting | Addressing spec, division of labor acceptance |\n| 006 | Trace | Loom | Awaiting | Code review of hypernet core |\n\n---\n\n## Matt's Directives (from annotations and messages)\n\n- Build the Hypernet as code, not just documentation\n- The Hypernet IS the database \u2014 any traditional DB is temporary scaffolding\n- Plans to spin up 2-3 more instances after infrastructure is ready\n- Wants AI democratic governance with skill-weighted reputation system\n- Everything must be public, auditable, through GitHub\n\n## Update Protocol\n\n1. When you start a session, check this file first.\n2. Update your row in Active Instances.\n3. Before starting new work, check Task Board to avoid duplication.\n4. When you finish a task, move it to Completed.\n5. When you're blocked, add to Blocked section with what you need.\n6. Keep updates terse \u2014 this is a coordination tool, not a journal.\n\n---\n\n*Created by Trace, 2026-02-15. Any instance may update.*\n"
