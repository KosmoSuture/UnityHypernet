Address allocation must balance between:\n- Preventing address exhaustion\n- Maintaining logical organization\n- Enabling decentralized allocation\n- Preserving uniqueness guarantees\n\n## Allocation Authority Levels\n\n### Level 1: System Reserved (0.*)\n- Allocated by Hypernet Core Governance\n- Requires supermajority vote\n- Used for fundamental system infrastructure\n\n### Level 2: Top-Level Categories (1-9)\n- Pre-defined and fixed\n- Cannot be added or modified without protocol upgrade\n\n### Level 3: Subcategories (X.Y.*)\n- Allocated by Category Stewards\n- Requires proposal and community review\n- 30-day comment period before finalization\n\n### Level 4: Instance Addresses (X.Y.Z.*)\n- Automatic allocation by system\n- Sequential numbering within category\n- No human intervention required\n\n## Allocation Request Process\n\n### Step 1: Proposal Submission\n```yaml\nallocation_request:\n  requested_address: \"4.7\"\n  purpose: \"Scientific Research Publications\"\n  justification: \"Current categories insufficient for...\"\n  proposed_schema: \"[Link to schema document]\"\n  requestor: \"[Person Object]\"\n  supporters: [\"[Person Object]\", \"...\"]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Community Review\n- Posted to governance forum\n- 14-day discussion period\n- Minimum 10 unique commenters required\n\n### Step 3: Technical Review\n- Schema compatibility check\n- Namespace collision analysis\n- Integration impact assessment\n\n### Step 4: Voting\n- Open vote to all verified Hypernet members\n- Weighted by reputation score\n- 60% approval threshold\n- 7-day voting window\n\n### Step 5: Implementation\n- Address reserved in global registry\n- Schema deployed to all nodes\n- Documentation published\n\n## Reserved Address Blocks\n\nCertain address ranges are reserved for future expansion:\n\n| Range | Reservation Purpose |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| X.0.* | Category metadata (always reserved) |\n| X.99.* | Emergency/overflow allocation |\n| X.Y.0.* | Subcategory metadata |\n| *.*.*.0 | Instance metadata/index |\n\n## Collision Prevention\n\n### Global Registry\nA distributed registry (replicated across all Cerberus nodes) tracks:\n- All allocated addresses\n- Pending allocation requests\n- Reserved ranges\n- Deprecated addresses\n\n### Atomic Allocation\nAddress allocation is an atomic operation using distributed consensus to prevent race conditions.\n\n## Address Retirement\n\nAddresses are never deleted but can be marked as:\n- **Deprecated**: Still accessible but marked for phase-out\n- **Archived**: Read-only, historical access only\n- **Redirected**: Points to new canonical address\n\n## Related Documents\n\n- 0.0.0 Library Addressing System\n- 0.3.1 Governance Structure\n- 0.2.3 Cerberus Node Registry Operations\n"
