We worked **iteratively** - constant back-and-forth, refinement, building on each other's ideas.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Interaction Pattern\\n\\n**Typical Exchange:**\\n\\n```\\nHuman: \\\"I want to build Hypernet full-time and need $500K funding ASAP\\\"\\n\\nAI: [Immediately shifts entire approach]\\n     - Creates investor outreach kit\\n     - Builds financial projections\\n     - Drafts pitch deck\\n     - Prepares demo video plan\\n     - All within funding context\"\n  },\n  \"created_at\": \"2026-02-15T11:53:48.165555+00:00\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-15T11:53:48.165555+00:00\",\n  \"deleted_at\": null,\n  \"source_type\": \"import\",\n  \"source_id\": \"file:AI-COFOUNDER-COLLABORATION.md\"\n}"
