Photos in 5 places, emails in 3, documents everywhere. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.\\n\\nOur solution:\\n\\u2022 Unified data layer (every object gets a Hypernet Address - like DNS for personal data)\\n\\u2022 Immersive VR interface (Meta Quest 3)\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace where users get paid $5-50/month when AI companies access their data\\n\\nWe have a working demo on Quest 3. I'd love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes - it's the most effective way to understand what we're building.\\n\\nRaising $500K seed to get to 100K users in 12 months. Given Boost's focus on VR and sci-fi tech, I thought this would be a perfect fit.\\n\\nAvailable for a call this week or next?\\n\\nBest,\\nMatt Schaeffer\\nFounder & CEO, Hypernet\\n[Your email]\\n[Your phone]\\n\\nP.S. - We've documented the entire architecture (260K+ words) and have working code. This isn't vaporware.\\n```\\n\\n**Why this works:**\\n- Boost literally specializes in VR\\n- Personal data + VR is their sweet spot\\n- Demo offer (experience > slides)\\n- Shows traction (working code)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Email #2: The VR Fund\\n\\n**To:** hello@thevr.fund (or find specific partner on their site)\\n**Subject:** The Productivity Layer for Consumer VR\\n\\n**Body:**\\n```\\nHi VR Fund team,\\n\\nQuick question: What's the killer app for consumer VR beyond gaming?\\n\\nI'm Matt Schaeffer, and I think the answer is: \\\"See your entire digital life in 3D.\\\"\\n\\nI'm building Hypernet - a personal data OS in VR. We unify all your data (photos, emails, documents, calendar) and let you navigate it spatially on Quest 3.\\n\\nEarly prototype works. Put on the headset, see your photos arranged by date in 3D space, ask the AI assistant \\\"show me photos from Christmas,\\\" and boom - they appear instantly.\\n\\nThree reasons this is the VR productivity layer:\\n1. Everyone has this problem (data fragmentation)\\n2. VR makes it intuitive (spatial > 2D folders)\\n3. Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn $20/mo)\\n\\nRaising $500K.

You helped create the VR hardware revolution. I'm building what I think is the next layer: the productivity use case that makes VR essential for everyone.\\n\\nHypernet: Personal data OS in VR.\\n\\nThe insight: VR headsets are amazing, but most people only use them for games. We're building the \\\"non-gaming killer app\\\" - unified access to your digital life with a beautiful VR interface.\\n\\nWorking demo on Quest 3:\\n\\u2022 Import all your data (photos, emails, calendar)\\n\\u2022 See it in immersive 3D\\n\\u2022 Navigate spatially (much better than folders/files)\\n\\u2022 AI assistant with full context (\\\"what did I do last summer?\\\")\\n\\nThe business:\\n\\u2022 Consumer: $10/mo for unlimited storage + VR features\\n\\u2022 AI marketplace: Companies pay users for data access\\n\\u2022 Enterprise: Corporate data management\\n\\nI'm raising $500K seed.
