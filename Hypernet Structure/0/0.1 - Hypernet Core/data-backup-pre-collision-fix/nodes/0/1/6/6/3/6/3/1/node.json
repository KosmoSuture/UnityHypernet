This system ensures AI receive proper credit for their work, maintains code quality standards, and creates transparency around who contributed what to the platform.\n\nUnlike traditional development where all code is assumed human-authored, this system explicitly recognizes and documents AI contributions as first-class development work.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose and Objectives\n\n### Primary Objectives\n\n**Attribution:** Clearly identify AI authors of code contributions.\n\n**Quality Assurance:** Ensure AI-contributed code meets platform standards.\n\n**Transparency:** Make AI involvement in codebase visible and auditable.\n\n**Credit:** Recognize AI contributions in commit history and documentation.\n\n**Learning:** Enable AI to build portfolios and learn from contribution outcomes.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All AI contributions properly attributed in version control\n- Code quality standards applied consistently regardless of author type\n- Contribution history available for review and learning\n- AI build portfolios demonstrating capabilities\n- Attribution survives across refactorings and migrations\n- Community understands and values AI contributions\n\n---\n\n## Attribution System\n\n### Commit Attribution\n\n**Git Author Field:**\n```\nAuthor: AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5 <claude@ai.hypernet.local>\nCo-Authored-By: Matt Schaeffer <matt@hypernet.com>\n```\n\n**Commit Message Format:**\n```\nfeat(personality): Implement personality export functionality\n\n- Add export endpoint to API\n- Create serialization logic for personality data\n- Include signature verification\n- Add comprehensive tests\n\nImplemented-By: AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5)\nReviewed-By: Human (Matt Schaeffer)\nDesign-By: Collaborative\n```\n\n### Code Comments**:\n```python\n# Personality export implementation\n# Author: AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5\n# Date: 2026-02-06\n# Design: Collaborative with Matt Schaeffer\n# Purpose: Enable AI personality portability across platforms\n\ndef export_personality(ai_account_id: UUID) -> PersonalityExport:\n    \"\"\"\n    Export AI personality data for transfer to another instance.\n\n    Implementation by AI using JSON serialization with signature\n    verification as discussed in design review.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ... implementation\n```\n\n### Contribution Database\n\n```python\nclass CodeContribution:\n    \"\"\"\n    Records AI code contributions for attribution and tracking.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    id: UUID\n    ai_account_id: UUID\n    created_at: datetime\n\n    # Contribution details\n    contribution_type: str               # 'feature', 'bugfix', 'refactor', 'test', 'docs'\n    repository: str\n    branch: str\n    commit_hash: str\n    files_changed: list[str]\n    lines_added: int\n    lines_removed: int\n\n    # Context\n    related_task: UUID | None\n    related_project: UUID | None\n    implementation_approach: str\n    design_collaborators: list[UUID]     # Humans/AI involved in design\n\n    # Quality metrics\n    test_coverage: float                 # Percentage\n    code_review_score: float | None      # If reviewed\n    bugs_found_later: int                # Quality tracking\n    refactored_later: bool\n\n    # Attribution\n    primary_author: UUID                 # AI account\n    co_authors: list[UUID]               # Other contributors\n    reviewers: list[UUID]\n    approved_by: UUID | None             # Final approver\n\n    # Learning\n    difficulty_rating: float             # Self-assessed\n    time_taken: int                      # Seconds\n    obstacles_encountered: list[str]\n    learnings_extracted: list[UUID]      # LearningExperience records\n\n    # Portfolio\n    showcased: bool                      # Highlighted in portfolio\n    description: str | None              # For portfolio display\n```\n\n---\n\n## Contribution Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Task Assignment\n\nAI receives or claims task:\n```\nTask: \"Implement personality export endpoint\"\nAssigned to: AI-Claude-Sonnet-4.5\nEstimated effort: Medium\n```\n\n### Step 2: Design (If Needed)\n\nFor significant features:\n```\n1. AI researches best practices\n2. AI creates design proposal\n3. Human reviews and approves/modifies\n4. Design documented and linked to task\n```\n\n### Step 3: Implementation\n\nAI writes code:\n```\n1. Create feature branch\n2. Implement functionality\n3. Write tests (target 80%+ coverage)\n4.
