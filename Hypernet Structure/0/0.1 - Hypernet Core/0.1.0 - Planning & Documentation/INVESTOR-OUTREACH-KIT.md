## Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Outreach (VR Investor)

**Subject:** VR Personal Data OS - Demo Available

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building Hypernet - a personal data operating system with a VR interface for Meta Quest 3.

The problem: Your digital life is scattered across 50+ apps. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.

Our solution: Unified data layer (think DNS for personal data) + immersive VR interface + AI marketplace where users get paid for data access.

We have a working demo on Quest 3. I'd love to put you in the headset for 10 minutes - it's the best way to understand what we're building.

Raising $500K seed to scale to 100K users. [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out.

Available for a call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Quick pitch deck: [Link if you have one online]
```

### Template 2: Cold Outreach (Consumer/Data Investor)

**Subject:** Users earning $20/mo from their data - interested?

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Do you think people should get paid when AI companies use their data?

I'm building Hypernet - the first platform where users control their personal data and earn passive income when AI companies access it.

It's like if Notion, Google Photos, and Bloomberg Terminal had a baby in VR.

Early numbers are promising:
- Working prototype (Quest 3 VR demo)
- Complete architecture (260K+ words documented)
- Clear path to 4 revenue streams

Raising $500K to get to 100K users + $2M ARR in 12 months.

[Mutual connection] thought this might be up your alley. 15-min call?

Best,
[Your Name]

Demo video: [Link]
```

### Template 3: Warm Intro (Have Mutual Connection)

**Subject:** [Mutual Friend] suggested we connect - VR + Data

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual Friend] suggested I reach out. I'm building Hypernet - essentially a personal OS in VR where users own their data and get paid when AI companies access it.

We've built a working Quest 3 demo that's pretty magical - you can see your entire digital life (photos, emails, calendar) in immersive 3D, and ask an AI assistant questions about it.

Raising $500K seed. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR or personal data infrastructure.

Available this week for a quick call?

Thanks!
[Your Name]

Quick overview: [One-pager PDF if you have it]
```

### Template 4: Follow-Up (No Response After 1 Week)

**Subject:** Re: VR Personal Data OS - Demo Available

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my email below. Not sure if you saw it.

TL;DR: We're building a personal data OS in VR. Working demo. $500K raise.

If you're interested in VR or consumer data infrastructure, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we've built.

If not, no worries - happy to loop back in a few months when we have traction.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 5: Demo Request Response

**Subject:** Re: Demo Request

```
Hi [Name],

Great! The demo is about 20-30 minutes:
- 5 min overview of problem/solution
- 15 min in the VR headset
- 10 min Q&A

Options this week:
- [Day] at [Time]
- [Day] at [Time]
- [Day] at [Time]

Location: [Your office/home, or I can come to you if local]

What you'll need: Just yourself. I'll bring the Quest 3.

Looking forward to it!

## Handling Common Objections

### "How do you compete with Google/Meta?"
**Answer:** "They're not building this. Google wants data siloed (it's their business model). Meta's focused on social VR, not personal data management. We're serving an unmet need they can't/won't serve."

### "What's your moat?"
**Answer:** "Three things: 1) Network effects - more user data = better AI = more users. 2) Switching costs - once your life is in Hypernet, hard to leave. 3) Hypernet Addressing system - technical architecture that's genuinely innovative."

### "Why will people pay $10/month?"
**Answer:** "They're already paying for Notion, iCloud, Dropbox, etc. - that's $20-30/month fragmented. Plus, they EARN money from AI marketplace. So net cost might be zero or negative."

### "This seems early for VR?"
**Answer:** "Quest 3 just hit $500 price point with great quality. 10M+ units sold. Apple just validated premium market with Vision Pro. Early, yes - but that's the opportunity. We're building the infrastructure layer before everyone else realizes they need it."

### "How do you get users?"
**Answer:** "Two angles: 1) VR enthusiasts want apps that use their real data. 2) Privacy-conscious people want data control. We're targeting both. Plus viral loop: 'I'm earning $20/month from my data' is extremely shareable."

### "What if regulations change?"
**Answer:** "Regulations are moving IN OUR FAVOR. GDPR, CCPA give users data rights. AI regulations will require transparency. We're building what regulations are demanding."

### "Team is small?"
**Answer:** "Intentionally lean until funded. I've architected everything, built working demo. With $500K, I hire 2 senior engineers who've shipped VR apps. We'll move fast."

## Terms to Aim For

### Seed Round Structure

**Option 1: Priced Round**
- Amount: $500,000
- Valuation: $3M-$5M post-money

- ✅ Quarterly updates

**What to Push Back On:**
- ❌ Excessive dilution (< 10% is hard to get excited about)
- ❌ Super-voting rights
- ❌ Blocking rights on future raises
- ❌ Personal guarantees

### First Check vs. Lead

**First $100K (First Check):**
- Often easier to close
- Use to create momentum
- Angels or micro VCs
- Less diligence, faster

**Lead Investor ($200K-300K):**
- Sets terms for round
- Does most diligence

## Final Tips

### What Investors Really Care About

1. **Team** - Can you execute? (Demo proves this)
2. **Market** - Is it big enough? (Yes, $2T)
3. **Product** - Does it work? (VR demo proves it)
4. **Traction** - Any validation? (Early but yes)
5. **Vision** - Is it compelling? (Trillion-dollar narrative)

### Your Advantages

- ✅ Working demo (most founders have slides only)
- ✅ VR is timely (investor interest high)
- ✅ Clear narrative (user ownership resonates)
- ✅ Technical depth (260K+ words of docs)
- ✅ Multiple revenue streams (not just one bet)

### Remember

- **Fundraising is a numbers game** - 50 contacts → 10 meetings → 2 term sheets is normal
- **The demo is everything** - If they don't try the headset, they won't invest
- **Momentum matters** - First check is hardest, then it cascades
- **You're interviewing them too** - Find investors who add value, not just money
