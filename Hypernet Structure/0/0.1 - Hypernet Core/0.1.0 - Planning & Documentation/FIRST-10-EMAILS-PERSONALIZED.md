**When to send:** Monday morning (10 emails, one hour)
**Follow up:** If no response in 7 days

## Email #1: Boost VC (VR Accelerator)

**To:** team@boost.vc
**CC:** (none)
**Subject:** VR Personal Data OS - Working Quest 3 Demo

**Body:**
```
Hi Boost VC team,

I'm Matt Schaeffer, building Hypernet - a personal data operating system with a VR interface on Meta Quest 3.

The problem: Your digital life is scattered across 50+ apps. Photos in 5 places, emails in 3, documents everywhere. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.

Our solution:
• Unified data layer (every object gets a Hypernet Address - like DNS for personal data)
• Immersive VR interface (Meta Quest 3)
• AI marketplace where users get paid $5-50/month when AI companies access their data

We have a working demo on Quest 3. I'd love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes - it's the most effective way to understand what we're building.

Raising $500K seed to get to 100K users in 12 months. Given Boost's focus on VR and sci-fi tech, I thought this would be a perfect fit.

Available for a call this week or next?

Best,
Matt Schaeffer
Founder & CEO, Hypernet
[Your email]
[Your phone]

P.S. - We've documented the entire architecture (260K+ words) and have working code. This isn't vaporware.
```

**Why this works:**
- Boost literally specializes in VR
- Personal data + VR is their sweet spot
- Demo offer (experience > slides)
- Shows traction (working code)

## Email #2: The VR Fund

**To:** hello@thevr.fund (or find specific partner on their site)
**Subject:** The Productivity Layer for Consumer VR

**Body:**
```
Hi VR Fund team,

Quick question: What's the killer app for consumer VR beyond gaming?

I'm Matt Schaeffer, and I think the answer is: "See your entire digital life in 3D."

I'm building Hypernet - a personal data OS in VR. We unify all your data (photos, emails, documents, calendar) and let you navigate it spatially on Quest 3.

Early prototype works. Put on the headset, see your photos arranged by date in 3D space, ask the AI assistant "show me photos from Christmas," and boom - they appear instantly.

Three reasons this is the VR productivity layer:
1. Everyone has this problem (data fragmentation)
2. VR makes it intuitive (spatial > 2D folders)
3. Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn $20/mo)

Raising $500K. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR productivity applications.

15-min call this week?

Matt Schaeffer

Demo screenshots: [Link when you have them]
```

**Why this works:**
- Asks engaging question upfront
- Positions as THE productivity app VR needs
- Concrete example they can visualize
- Revenue angle (users earning)

## Email #3: Brendan Iribe (Oculus Co-Founder)

**To:** [Find via LinkedIn - may need to InMail]
**Subject:** Building the missing layer for consumer VR

**Body:**
```
Hi Brendan,

I've followed your work since the Oculus days. You helped create the VR hardware revolution. I'm building what I think is the next layer: the productivity use case that makes VR essential for everyone.

Hypernet: Personal data OS in VR.

The insight: VR headsets are amazing, but most people only use them for games. We're building the "non-gaming killer app" - unified access to your digital life with a beautiful VR interface.

Working demo on Quest 3:
• Import all your data (photos, emails, calendar)
• See it in immersive 3D
• Navigate spatially (much better than folders/files)
• AI assistant with full context ("what did I do last summer?")

The business:
• Consumer: $10/mo for unlimited storage + VR features
• AI marketplace: Companies pay users for data access
• Enterprise: Corporate data management

I'm raising $500K seed. Given your deep understanding of what VR needs to succeed, I'd greatly value your feedback - even if you're not investing, your insights would be invaluable.

Any chance you're open to a 20-min call?

Best,
Matt Schaeffer
Founder, Hypernet
[Contact info]
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you know his background
- Flattering but not obsequious
- Clearly articulates "the missing piece"
- Asks for feedback (not just money)
- Respects his time

## Email #4: Union Square Ventures

**To:** [Find specific partner interested in data/user ownership on usv.com]
**Subject:** User-owned data network + VR interface

**Body:**
```
Hi [Partner Name],

I'm building Hypernet, and I think it aligns perfectly with USV's thesis on user-owned data networks.

The setup: Your data is fragmented across 50+ services, controlled by Big Tech, and AI companies profit from it without compensating you.

Our approach:
• Unified personal data layer (users own everything)
• Hypernet Addressing system (like URLs for your life)
• AI marketplace where users get paid for data access ($5-50/mo passive income)
• VR interface (Quest 3) makes it beautiful

This creates a network effect: More users → more data → better AI context → more value → more users.

Early demo works on Quest 3. We're raising $500K to get to 100K users and $2M ARR in 12 months.

Given USV's focus on user ownership and data networks, I'd love to show you what we're building. Would you be open to a 20-min call?

Best,
Matt Schaeffer
[Contact info]
```

**Why this works:**
- USV is famous for user-owned networks thesis
- Direct connection to their investment philosophy
- Network effects (they love this)
- Revenue clarity

## Email #5: Initialized Capital (Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian)

**To:** [Find on initialized.com - they have a form too]
**Subject:** Finally, a VR app normal people will use daily

**Body:**
```
Hi Initialized team,

Most VR apps are games or social experiments. We're building the first VR productivity app that normal people will use every day: Hypernet.

The pitch: Your digital life (photos, emails, documents) in immersive VR. Working demo on Quest 3.

Why this works:
• Problem is universal (everyone's data is fragmented)
• VR makes it delightful (not just functional)
• Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn $20/mo)

Why now:
• Quest 3 is $500 and great quality (10M+ sold)
• AI boom means everyone understands why personal data matters
• Privacy regulations favor user ownership

Traction:
• Working prototype (Quest 3)
• Complete architecture documented (260K+ words - we're serious)
• Clear path to 4 revenue streams

Raising $500K seed. Would love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes.

Available this week?

Matt Schaeffer
Founder, Hypernet
[Contact info]
```

**Why this works:**
- Differentiation clear upfront (productivity, not gaming)
- "Normal people will use daily" = mass market
- Shows traction beyond just idea
- Concise but complete

## Email #6: Homebrew (Hunter Walk, Satya Patel)

**To:** [Find on homebrew.co]
**Subject:** The user data control layer + passive income

**Body:**
```
Hi Homebrew team,

I'm building Hypernet - essentially Notion + Google Photos + Bloomberg Terminal, but in VR, where users get paid when AI companies access their data.

The opportunity: Everyone wants unified personal data, but existing tools are either:
• Too simple (just notes)
• Too corporate (enterprise-focused)
• Don't compensate users (Big Tech model)

We're different:
• Comprehensive (photos, emails, documents, calendar, everything)
• Beautiful (VR interface on Quest 3)
• Fair (users earn $20/mo from AI marketplace)

Working demo. Raising $500K to get to 100K users.

Given Homebrew's focus on consumer and founder-friendly terms, would love to chat.

Coffee this week?

Matt Schaeffer
[Contact info]
```

**Why this works:**
- Homebrew likes consumer + data
- Comparison to known products
- "Founder-friendly terms" (they pride themselves on this)
- Casual tone matches their brand

## Email #7: Naval Ravikant (Angel)

**To:** [Twitter DM if you can't find email]
**Subject:** Users owning their data (actually implemented)

**Body:**
```
Hi Naval,

You've written about users needing to own their data. I've built the practical implementation: Hypernet.

The stack:
• Universal addressing (every object gets a Hypernet Address)
• First-class links (everything connects to everything)
• User ownership (data stored locally or user's cloud choice)
• AI marketplace (companies pay users $5-50/mo for access)
• VR interface (Quest 3) for navigation

This flips the script: Instead of users being the product, users GET PAID.

Working demo on Quest 3. Raising $500K.

I know your time is precious, but if you're interested in practical user data ownership, I'd love 15 minutes to show you.

Worth a look?

Matt Schaeffer
[Contact info]
```

**Why this works:**
- Naval tweets about this constantly
- "Actually implemented" (not just theory)
- Technical details show credibility
- Respects his time

## Email #8: Balaji Srinivasan (Angel)

**To:** [Find on Twitter/LinkedIn]
**Subject:** Data sovereignty + cryptographic addressing

**Body:**
```
Balaji,

I'm building the sovereignty stack you've described: Hypernet - personal data OS with cryptographic addressing and user control.

The architecture:
• Hypernet Addressing (every object gets a unique address)
• Local-first storage (user controls where data lives)
• Cryptographic verification (you can prove ownership)
• AI access marketplace (transparent, compensated)
• VR interface (Quest 3 as native UI layer)

This is the full stack:
• Own your data ✓
• Control access ✓
• Get compensated ✓
• Beautiful UX ✓

Working demo. Raising $500K.

If the sovereignty stack interests you, I'd love to show you what we've built.

15-min call?

Matt Schaeffer
[Contact info]
```

**Why this works:**
- Balaji is big on sovereignty
- Technical language he uses
- Checks all his boxes
- Architecture-first (he respects this)

**To:** [Find partner on firstround.com]
**Subject:** Pre-seed - Personal OS in VR

**Body:**
```
Hi [Partner Name],

I'm raising pre-seed/seed for Hypernet - think of it as "iOS for your personal data, but the interface is VR."

The insight: Everyone wants unified personal data, but 2D interfaces make it feel like work. VR makes it magical.

Working demo (Quest 3):

• Navigate spatially in 3D
• Ask AI assistant anything about your life
• It has full context, gives perfect answers

The business model:
• Consumer: $10/mo subscription
• AI marketplace: Users earn $20/mo selling data access
• Net cost to user: NEGATIVE (they get paid!)

Raising $500K. First Round's focus on technical founders + consumer = perfect fit.

Can I show you the demo this week?

Matt Schaeffer

**Why this works:**
- First Round loves technical founders
- "iOS for personal data" is clear positioning
- Net negative cost is compelling hook
- Flatters them (perfect fit)
