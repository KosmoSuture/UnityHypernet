# 0.5.13 — Legal Object Schema

## Overview

Legal objects represent instruments that create, modify, or extinguish legal rights and obligations. This category covers agreements, regulations, intellectual property, disputes, and estate instruments — anything that establishes enforceable relationships between parties under a governing law.

**Why a separate category:** Legal objects have a unique structural signature: parties, obligations, jurisdiction, effective dates. No other object type has these as essential properties. Forcing legal data into Document or Event loses the semantic precision needed for queries like "What obligations do I have expiring this quarter?" or "Which agreements require renewal under California law?"

**Parent type:** 0.5.0 (Master Object Schema)

## Privacy & Security Notes

Legal data demands the highest levels of protection in the Hypernet:

1. **Attorney-client privilege** — Privileged materials must be flagged with `enforcement.compliance` markers and access restricted accordingly. Inadvertent disclosure can waive privilege permanently.
2. **Sealed records** — Court-sealed documents must restrict access to authorized parties only. The `flags` field should indicate sealing status.
3. **Identity documents** — Never store full document numbers in cleartext. Use masked versions (`****4532`). Full numbers should be stored only in the Gen 1 `access.encryption` section.
4. **Amendment integrity** — The amendment history chain must be immutable once recorded. Each amendment should reference the prior version's HA for auditability.
5. **Jurisdiction-specific compliance** — Legal objects may be subject to GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), attorney-client privilege rules, or judicial sealing orders. The `flags` field should indicate applicable compliance requirements.
6. **Retention policies** — Many legal objects have mandatory retention periods. Automated deletion must check legal hold status before removing any legal object.

## Mapping from 0.4 Object Type Registry

The 0.4 registry did not define formal Legal types. Legal objects were planned but not implemented — they were handled informally as tagged documents. The following mappings apply:

| Informal 0.4 Usage | 0.5.13 Type |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Document tagged "contract" | 0.5.13.1.1 Contract |
| Document tagged "license" | 0.5.13.1.2 License Agreement |
| Document tagged "nda" | 0.5.13.1.4 Non-Disclosure Agreement |
| Document tagged "policy" | 0.5.13.2.5 Policy |
| Document tagged "patent" | 0.5.13.3.1 Patent |
| Document tagged "permit" | 0.5.13.2.3 Permit / License |

This schema provides the formal definitions that were previously handled as tagged documents.
