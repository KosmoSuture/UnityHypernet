# 0.5.2 Person Object Schema

## Overview

Person Objects represent individual human beings in the Hypernet. They are the foundation of identity, ownership, and social interaction in the system. The Mandala structure ensures privacy while enabling trust.

## Schema Definition

```yaml
person_object:
  # === BASE OBJECT (inherited from 0.5.0) ===
  _extends: "hypernet_object"
  object_type: "person"

## Privacy Architecture

### Mandala Segments
Each segment can have different access rules:

```yaml
access_policy_example:
  segment: "contact_info"
  rules:
    - type: "identity"
      allowed: ["mandala_id_1", "mandala_id_2"]  # Specific people

    - type: "relationship"
      allowed: ["collaborators"]  # Anyone in collaborators list

    - type: "attribute"
      required:
        reputation_minimum: 0.7
        verified_human: true

    - type: "purpose"
      allowed_purposes: ["professional_contact", "emergency"]
      requires_justification: true

    - type: "time"
      valid_hours: "09:00-17:00"
      timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
```

### Zero-Knowledge Verification
Cerberus can verify attributes without revealing them:
- "Is this person over 18?" → Yes/No (without revealing age)
- "Does this person have skill X?" → Yes/No (without revealing all skills)
- "Is this person in region Y?" → Yes/No (without revealing exact location)

## Identity Verification Levels

| Level | Requirements | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Basic | Email verification | Basic account |
| Standard | Phone + email | Voting, contributions |
| Enhanced | Government ID | Governance eligibility |
| Full | Biometric + in-person | Maximum trust |
| Vouched | Enhanced + 3 endorsements | Steward eligibility |

## Linking to People

### From Other Objects
```yaml
# In a Document Object
authorship:
  authors: ["1.1", "1.42"]  # Person addresses

# In an Organization Object
members:
  - person: "1.1"
    role: "Founder"
    since: "2025-01-01"
```

### From People to People
```yaml
# Collaboration link
link_type: "collaborates_with"
source: "1.1"
target: "1.42"
metadata:
  projects: ["3.1.2"]
  since: "2025-01-15"
```
