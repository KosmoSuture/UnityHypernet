# 0.5.3 Device Object Schema

## Overview

Device Objects represent physical or virtual computing devices connected to the Hypernet. This includes personal devices, IoT sensors, servers, and virtual machines. Devices can own data, run nodes, and interact with the network.

## Device Registration

### Registration Flow
```
1. Install Hypernet client on device
2. Generate cryptographic identity
3. Link to owner's Mandala
4. Register device Object
5. Configure capabilities and sharing
6. Begin network participation
```

### Registration Request
```yaml
registration_request:
  device_identity:
    device_type: "personal_computer"
    manufacturer: "Apple"
    model: "MacBook Pro 16"
    public_key: "[Generated key]"

  owner_authorization:
    owner_mandala: "[Owner's Mandala ID]"
    signature: "[Owner's signature]"

  initial_configuration:
    device_name: "Matt's Laptop"
    hypernet_roles:
      can_store: true
      storage_limit_gb: 100
```

## IoT Integration

### Sensor Data Flow
```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  Sensor  │───►│  Device  │───►│ Hypernet │───►│ Consumer │
│          │    │  Object  │    │  Storage │    │  Objects │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
               ┌──────────┐
               │ Privacy  │
               │  Filter  │
               └──────────┘
```

### Data Sharing Policies
```yaml
sensor_sharing_policy:
  raw_data:
    share: false
    reason: "Privacy - location inference possible"

  aggregated_data:
    share: true
    aggregation_period: "1_hour"
    minimum_samples: 10

  derived_insights:
    share: true
    example: "Average temperature: 22°C"
```

## VR Device Integration

VR headsets have special capabilities:
```yaml
