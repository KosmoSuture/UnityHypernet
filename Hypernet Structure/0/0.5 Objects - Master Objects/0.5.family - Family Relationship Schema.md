# 0.5.family — Family Relationship Schema

## Core Principle

Family is the first trust network. Before institutions, before governments, before any social structure — there was family. The Hypernet models family as a **collective unit** with shared identity, resources, and communication, while preserving each member's individual sovereignty.

Matt (1.1): *"This family section, and how it could connect people, and families is going to blow people's minds."*

## Why Family Is Critical

The family structure solves problems that no existing platform addresses:

1. **Trust at scale** — A family member verifying another family member creates the strongest trust link in the system. This chain extends outward to friends, communities, the world.
2. **Resource management** — Families share resources (finances, calendars, documents, photos) but no platform lets them do this with full data ownership.
3. **Cross-generational permanence** — A family's history should survive any platform, any company, any technology shift. The Hypernet address system makes family records permanent.
4. **Global connection** — Families across the world can connect and learn from each other while maintaining cultural autonomy and privacy.
5. **Fraud prevention** — Verified familial connections make identity fraud exponentially harder.

## The Family Object

A Family is a first-class object in the Hypernet. It is not just a collection of links between Person objects — it is an entity with its own address, its own resources, and its own governance.

```yaml
family_object:

## Relationship Types

### Core Family Relations

| Type | Directed | Symmetric | Trust Weight | Verification |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `parent_of` / `child_of` | Yes | No | 0.9-1.0 | Document or mutual confirmation |
| `sibling_of` | No | Yes | 0.8-0.9 | Parent confirmation |
| `spouse_of` | No | Yes | 0.9-1.0 | Document or mutual confirmation |
| `grandparent_of` / `grandchild_of` | Yes | No | 0.7-0.9 | Chain verification (parent → parent) |
| `guardian_of` / `ward_of` | Yes | No | 0.8-1.0 | Legal document verification |

### Extended Family Relations

| Type | Directed | Trust Weight | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| `uncle_aunt_of` / `niece_nephew_of` | Yes | 0.5-0.7 | Derived from sibling + parent chains |
| `cousin_of` | No | 0.4-0.6 | Derived from parent sibling chains |
| `in_law` | No | 0.4-0.7 | Derived from spouse + parent/sibling |
| `step_parent_of` / `step_child_of` | Yes | 0.6-0.9 | Spouse's child |
| `adoptive_parent_of` / `adopted_child_of` | Yes | 0.9-1.0 | Legal, same rights as biological |
| `godparent_of` / `godchild_of` | Yes | 0.4-0.6 | Cultural/religious, mutual confirmation |
| `foster_parent_of` / `foster_child_of` | Yes | 0.7-0.9 | Legal, may be temporary |

### Non-Biological Family

The Hypernet recognizes that family is not limited to biology:

- **Chosen family** — People who declare each other as family through mutual confirmation. Trust weight: 0.5-0.8
- **Cultural family** — Extended kinship structures (clans, tribes, houses) recognized by community confirmation. Trust weight: 0.3-0.6
- **Blended family** — Step-relationships, adopted relationships, all treated with full dignity. Same trust weights as biological equivalents when legally established.

## Trust Propagation Through Family

Family creates the strongest trust links in the Hypernet. Trust flows through family relationships according to these rules:

### Within a Family Unit

```
Parent (1.0) ←→ Spouse (1.0)
    ↓ 0.9              ↓ 0.9
  Child              Child
    ↓ 0.8
  Child's Spouse (in-law)
    ↓ 0.7
  Child's Spouse's Family
```

### Across Families

When families connect through marriage, friendship, or community, trust propagates with diminishing weight:

```
Family A                    Family B
┌──────────┐   marriage    ┌──────────┐
│ Parent A  │←────0.9────→ │ Parent B  │
│   (1.0)   │              │   (0.9)   │
│           │              │           │
│ Child A   │   in-law     │ Sibling B │
│   (0.9)   │←────0.5────→ │   (0.7)   │
└──────────┘              └──────────┘
```

### Trust to Friend Networks

```
Family Member (1.0) → Friend (0.5) → Friend's Family (0.3) → Friend's Friend (0.15)
```

Each hop beyond the family unit applies a decay factor. The exact factor depends on:
- Relationship type (family > friend > acquaintance)
- Reputation score of the intermediary (from `0.3.3`)
- Duration of the relationship
- Verification status

## Privacy Levels

Family data has four privacy levels:

| Level | Visibility | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **family** | All family members | Calendar, photos, message board |
| **parents** | Parents/guardians only | Financial records, legal docs |
| **individual** | The person + parents (if minor) | Personal medical, school records |
| **private** | The person only | Personal journal, private thoughts |

### Age-Based Privacy

As children age, their privacy autonomy increases:

| Age | Privacy Rights |
|-----|---------------|
| 0-12 | Parents have full access to child's family-level data |
| 13-15 | Child gains governance vote, some data becomes individual-level |
| 16-17 | Most personal data becomes individual-level, parents retain emergency access |
| 18+ | Full sovereignty over all personal data, parents lose automatic access |

These are defaults. Each family can configure thresholds within legal requirements of their jurisdiction.

## Family Operations

### Creating a Family

1. A Person declares a family unit (becomes founder)
2. Founder invites members with relationship declarations
3. Each invited member confirms the relationship (mutual confirmation)
4. Family object is created with shared resources
5. Trust links are automatically generated between all confirmed members

### Adding Members

- **Birth/Adoption:** Parent adds child with document verification
- **Marriage:** Spouse added with mutual confirmation + optional document verification
- **Extended family:** Invited by existing member, confirmed by at least one other member
- **Chosen family:** Mutual declaration by both parties, no document required

### Removing Members (Soft Delete)

Family relationships are permanent history. Members can be removed from active family operations, but the historical relationship record is preserved:

- **Divorce:** Spouse relationship marked as `ended`, trust weight drops to 0.0-0.2
- **Estrangement:** Member sets relationship to `inactive`, data access revoked, historical record preserved
- **Death:** Member marked as `deceased`, memorial record created, contributions preserved

No family record is ever hard-deleted. This is permanent history with full audit trail.

## Cross-Family Features

### Family-to-Family Connections

Families can formally connect:

```yaml
family_connection:
  type: "allied"                         # allied | extended | community
  family_a: "[Family address]"
  family_b: "[Family address]"
  established_through: "[Person address]" # The person who connects them
  since: "date"
  shared_resources:
    - shared_calendar: false
    - shared_photos: true                 # e.g., family reunion albums
    - messaging: true
```

### Global Family Network

The Hypernet enables families worldwide to:
- **Connect across borders** — Immigrant families maintaining connections with home country relatives
- **Share cultural practices** — Opt-in sharing of traditions, recipes, stories
- **Collective advocacy** — Families with shared interests organizing together
- **Cross-cultural learning** — Families learning from each other's structures and traditions
- **Heritage preservation** — Multi-generational family histories preserved permanently

## Implementation Notes

### Matt's Vision

Matt (1.1): *"FAMILY STRUCTURE!! CRITICAL!! A super important structure that needs to be built. I want a section built for how each individual section of the family can connect to the rest of the family, how they can do ANYTHING that ANY family could POSSIBLY want to do with the technology available and at its absolute limit of creativity."*

This schema is the starting point. The implementation should push beyond current platforms:
- Full data ownership (no company owns your family photos)
- Inter-generational persistence (outlasts any platform)
- Cultural flexibility (works for every family structure worldwide)
- Privacy by design (not surveillance disguised as sharing)

### Addressing Convention

Family objects follow the Hypernet addressing system:

```
1.1.family              → Matt Schaeffer's family unit
1.1.family.calendar     → Family calendar
1.1.family.docs         → Shared documents
1.1.family.media        → Shared media
1.1.family.messages     → Family message board
1.1.family.finances     → Financial resources
1.1.family.emergency    → Emergency channel
```

Each sub-resource gets its own HA and is a permanent, addressable object.

### Integration Points

| System | Integration |
|--------|------------|
| Trust Framework (`0.3.7`) | Family relationships are the strongest trust links |
| Reputation System (`0.3.3`) | Family reputation contributes to individual reputation |
| Person Schema (`0.5.1`) | Person's `social_locker.family_connections` links to family objects |
| Link Definitions (`0.6.1`) | All family relationship subtypes defined under `related_to` |
| Boot Sequence (`2.1.27`) | AI entities can be "adopted" into family-like structures |
| Economy System | Family resource pooling and allowance distribution |
| Governance | Family-level voting on shared resource decisions |

*Family is the first network. Before the internet, before the telephone, before writing — humans organized into families. The Hypernet doesn't invent family. It gives family the tools that technology has always promised but never delivered: permanence, privacy, and connection without surveillance.*
