# 0.5.15 — Creative Work Object Schema

## Overview

Creative Work objects represent works whose primary identity is as a product of human or AI creative expression. This category covers paintings, novels, compositions, video games, architectural designs, performances, and any other artifact born from an intentional act of creative authorship.

**The distinction between Creative Work and Media/Document:** A Creative Work is the *cultural entity* — the conceptual work itself, with its authorship, influences, critical reception, and place in creative history. A Media object (0.5.4) or Document object (0.5.3) is a *physical or digital encoding* of that work. A JPEG file of a painting is a 0.5.4.1 Media object. The painting itself — the thing that was exhibited, reviewed, sold at auction, and influenced a generation of artists — is a 0.5.15 Creative Work. A PDF of a novel is a 0.5.3 Document. The novel as a literary work with an author, a publication history, and critical reception is a 0.5.15 Creative Work. The two are linked (via 0.6.* link types such as `manifested_as` or `represented_by`) but are fundamentally different objects answering different questions. The Creative Work answers "What was created and why does it matter?" while the Media/Document answers "What bytes represent it and how are they encoded?"

This separation matters in practice. A single painting may have dozens of Media representations (a high-resolution scan, a gallery thumbnail, a photograph taken by a visitor, a printed poster) — but they all refer to one Creative Work. Conversely, a Creative Work like a symphony may have no digital media at all if it has only been performed live and never recorded.

**Parent type:** 0.5.0 (Master Object Schema)
