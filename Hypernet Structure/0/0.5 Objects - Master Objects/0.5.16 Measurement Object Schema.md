# 0.5.16 — Measurement Object Schema

## Overview

Measurement objects represent raw data points, observations, sensor readings, and quantified values. A measurement is an atomic datum: a single value captured at a specific time, expressed in a specific unit, with known precision. Temperature readings from a thermostat, blood pressure from a cuff, GPS coordinates from a receiver, survey responses from a respondent — these are all measurements.

**Why a separate category:** Measurements have a unique structural signature: value, unit, precision, instrument, timestamp. They are the atomic building blocks of data. Documents (0.5.3) contain composed text; Events (0.5.7) represent things that happen at a time; measurements are neither. A measurement is a single quantified observation — a number with a unit and a provenance chain. Forcing a sensor reading into Document or Event loses the numeric precision, unit semantics, and time-series density that make measurement data scientifically and operationally valuable.

**Parent type:** 0.5.0 (Master Object Schema)

## Data Quality Notes

Measurement data is only as trustworthy as its provenance chain. The following practices are essential for scientific and operational reliability:

1. **Calibration** — Every instrument must have a known calibration date. An expired or missing calibration status (`calibration_status: "expired"` or `"unknown"`) should trigger a quality warning. Consumers of measurement data should weight uncalibrated readings lower or exclude them from critical calculations.
2. **Units** — Units must always be recorded explicitly; never assume. The `unit` field references 0.12.5 Units. Unit mismatches (e.g., mixing Celsius and Fahrenheit in a series) are a leading cause of measurement errors. The Hypernet should reject or flag series with inconsistent units.
3. **Precision and Accuracy** — Precision (number of significant digits) and accuracy (+/- tolerance) are distinct concepts. A thermometer that reads 22.347 C is precise; whether it is accurate depends on calibration. Always record both so downstream consumers can propagate uncertainty correctly.
4. **Uncertainty Propagation** — When measurements are combined (averaged, summed, derived), uncertainty compounds. The `quality.uncertainty` and `quality.confidence_interval` fields exist so that computed metrics (0.5.16.4) can trace their uncertainty back to source measurements.
5. **Instrument Drift** — Sensors degrade over time. A measurement taken on day 1 after calibration is more trustworthy than one taken on day 364. The `calibration_status` and instrument metadata allow consumers to assess drift risk.
6. **Environmental Context** — Many measurements are sensitive to environmental conditions (temperature affects pressure gauges; humidity affects electrical resistance). The `context.environment_conditions` field should be populated whenever environmental factors could influence the reading.
