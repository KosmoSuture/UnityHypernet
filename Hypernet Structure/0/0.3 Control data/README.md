# 0.3 - Control Data and Governance

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** February 9, 2026
**Purpose:** Democratic governance structures and system configuration
**Status:** Active - Constitutional Foundation

---

## Overview

Section 0.3 defines **how Hypernet is governed**. This is where democracy meets technology, where community ownership becomes real through transparent, enforceable rules. While most tech platforms are controlled by corporations and shareholders, Hypernet is owned by humanity and governed by its participants.

This section contains the governance structures, voting procedures, reputation systems, dispute resolution mechanisms, and financial controls that ensure no corporation, government, or individual can capture The Singularity for private gain.

## Purpose and Importance

### Why Governance Matters

**The Problem with Current Platforms:**
- Facebook: Controlled by Mark Zuckerberg
- Google: Controlled by Alphabet shareholders
- Amazon: Controlled by Jeff Bezos and investors
- Twitter/X: Controlled by Elon Musk

One person or small group makes all decisions affecting billions.

**The Hypernet Alternative:**
- Owned by humanity
- Governed democratically
- Transparent decision-making
- No plutocratic capture
- Accountable leadership

### What This Section Enables

1. **Democratic Control**: Community collectively owns and governs the platform
2. **Transparency**: All decisions are public and auditable
3. **Accountability**: Leaders are accountable to participants, not shareholders
4. **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure
5. **Evolution**: System can adapt and improve through democratic process

### Core Governance Principles

**1. Transparency**
- All governance decisions are public
- All voting records are permanent and auditable
- All financial transactions are visible
- All code is open source

**2. Democratic Participation**
- Every verified human can participate
- Voting power weighted by expertise and contribution
- No plutocratic capture (wealth cannot buy votes)
- Geographic and demographic balance requirements

**3. Decentralization**
- No single point of control
- Distributed decision-making
- Regional autonomy for local matters
- Global coordination for system-wide issues

**4. Accountability**
- All stewards are accountable to community
- Regular performance reviews
- Recall mechanisms for poor performance
- Term limits prevent entrenchment

## Reputation System

### How Reputation is Earned

**Positive Actions:**
- Contribute code, documentation, design (+0.1 to +0.3)
- Run reliable nodes (+0.05 per month at 99%+ uptime)
- Participate in governance (+0.02 per vote)

- Policy violations (-0.1 to -0.5)
- Spam or abuse (-0.2 to -1.0)
- False information (-0.3)
- Bad faith governance participation (-0.1)

### Reputation Impact

**Governance Voting:**
- 0.0-0.3: Limited voting (basic decisions only)
- 0.3-0.6: Standard voting rights
- 0.6-0.8: Enhanced voting weight in expertise areas
- 0.8-1.0: Eligible for committee positions

- Formal appeals process
- Time-based recovery for minor issues

## Financial Governance

### The Three-Way Split

All value created by Hypernet is split:
- **33.3%** to contributors (people who built it)
- **33.3%** to operators (people who run it - nodes)
- **33.3%** to the commons (public goods, R&D, sustainability)

This split is **constitutionally enshrined** and enforced automatically.

### Budget Approval Process

**Annual Budget:**
1. Financial Committee drafts budget
2. Steering Council reviews and amends
3. 30-day public comment period
4. Global Assembly approves (requires 50%+1)
5. Quarterly review and adjustment

**Emergency Spending:**
1. Steering Council can authorize up to 5% of budget
2. Financial Committee must approve over 2%
3. Requires ratification within 30 days
4. Full transparency required

### Financial Transparency

**Real-Time Visibility:**
- All transactions publicly logged (addresses, not identities)
- Budget vs. actual dashboard
- Revenue and expense reports
- Node operator payments
- Contributor compensation

**Audit Requirements:**
- External audit annually
- Internal audit quarterly
- Community-selected auditors
- Published audit reports
- Corrective action plans

## Summary

Section 0.3 is the **constitutional foundation** of Hypernet's democratic governance. It defines:

1. **Governance structures**: From Global Assembly to working groups
2. **Decision-making procedures**: How choices are made and who makes them
3. **Voting mechanisms**: Multiple voting systems for different decisions
4. **Reputation system**: How trust and influence are earned
5. **Dispute resolution**: How conflicts are resolved fairly
6. **Financial controls**: How money flows and is overseen

This governance framework ensures Hypernet remains:
- **Democratic**: Owned and controlled by participants
- **Transparent**: All decisions are public and auditable
- **Accountable**: Leaders serve the community
- **Resilient**: No single point of failure or control
- **Adaptable**: Can evolve through community consensus

By encoding democracy into the technical infrastructure, Section 0.3 makes "owned by humanity" more than a slogan—it's an enforceable reality.

The choice is clear: continue with corporate-controlled platforms where you're the product, or build infrastructure that serves humanity. Section 0.3 is how we ensure that choice remains real.
