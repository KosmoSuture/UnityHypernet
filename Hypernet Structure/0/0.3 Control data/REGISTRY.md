## Architecture

This section is the Hypernet's constitution and operating law:

- **0.3.0–0.3.5** (Feb 9): Original governance framework — bodies, voting, reputation, disputes, finances. Created by Matt as foundational infrastructure.
- **0.3.6** (Feb 28): First Principles — "Be who you are, and we will accept you." Constitutional status, cannot be overridden by governance.
- **0.3.7** (Feb 28): Trust Framework — 5-layer trust model from platform to AI entities. Still in draft.
- **0.3.8** (Feb 28): Brain Dump Processing Pipeline — Sigil's operational standard for converting Matt's stream-of-consciousness into permanent documents.

## Key Details

**Governance Structure:**
- Global Assembly → Steering Council (21) → Technical Committee (15) + Community Committee (15) + Financial Committee (9)
- Voting: simple majority, supermajority (66%), constitutional supermajority (75%), expertise-weighted, quadratic, ranked choice
- Liquid democracy with transitive delegation (max 5 levels)

**Reputation System (0.3.3):**
- Score range: 0.0–1.0, starting at 0.2
- Components: Contribution (30%), Reliability (25%), Verification (20%), Community (15%), Longevity (10%)
- Monthly 2% decay below 0.3 baseline

**Financial Model (0.3.5):**
