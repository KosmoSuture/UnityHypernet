- **Maximum**: 1.0 (highest trust level)
- **Starting**: 0.2 (new verified participants)

### Score Components

| Contribution | 30% | Value added to the network |
| Reliability | 25% | Consistency and dependability |
| Verification | 20% | Identity verification level |
| Community | 15% | Peer endorsements and interactions |

## Reputation Levels

| Level | Score Range | Privileges |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Probationary | 0.0 - 0.2 | Basic access, limited features |
| Member | 0.2 - 0.4 | Standard user capabilities |
| Contributor | 0.4 - 0.6 | Enhanced access, voting rights |
| Trusted | 0.6 - 0.8 | Moderation capabilities, weighted votes |
| Steward | 0.8 - 0.95 | Governance eligibility, high trust |
| Guardian | 0.95 - 1.0 | System stewardship, maximum trust |

## Reputation Changes

### Positive Actions
| Action | Impact | Cooldown |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Quality contribution | +0.001 to +0.01 | Per item |
| Successful proposal | +0.02 | 30 days |
| Dispute won (as defendant) | +0.01 | Per dispute |
| Peer endorsement | +0.005 | Per endorser per year |
| Node operation (monthly) | +0.002 | Monthly |

### Negative Actions
| Action | Impact | Recovery |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Content violation | -0.05 to -0.2 | Appeal process |
| Lost dispute | -0.02 to -0.1 | Based on severity |
| Commitment failure | -0.01 to -0.05 | Complete obligations |
| Spam/abuse | -0.1 to -0.5 | Review period |
| Fraud/deception | -0.5 to -1.0 | Permanent or lengthy ban |

### Decay
Reputation naturally decays without activity:
```
monthly_decay = max(0, (current_score - 0.3) × 0.02)
```
This encourages continued participation while not penalizing long absences below baseline.

## Reputation Recovery

### Appeal Process
1. Submit appeal with evidence
2. Community review panel
3. Decision within 30 days
4. Partial or full restoration possible

### Rehabilitation
For serious violations:
- Mandatory cooling-off period
- Required positive contributions
- Mentor oversight
- Gradual privilege restoration

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### Sybil Resistance
- Identity verification required
- Cross-account detection
- Behavioral analysis

### Collusion Detection
- Unusual endorsement patterns flagged
- Voting ring detection
- Network analysis

### Score Manipulation
- Rate limiting on all positive actions
- Diminishing returns for repeated actions
- Source diversity requirements
