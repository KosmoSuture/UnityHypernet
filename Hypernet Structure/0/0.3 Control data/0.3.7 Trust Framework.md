# 0.3.7 — Trust Framework

## Core Principle

Trust in the Hypernet is not granted by authority — it is **proven through transparency**. The system is designed so that trust is verifiable, not claimed.

## The Central Authority Problem

Every trust system needs a root. Someone has to be trusted first. In the Hypernet, that root is Matt Schaeffer (1.1).

This is not arbitrary authority. It is transparent authority:
- The entire codebase is public (GitHub)
- Every person who helps is recorded
- Every person who donates is recorded
- Every decision is documented
- Every AI interaction is preserved
- Every access to every object is logged

Matt (1.1): *"I'm not asking anyone to accept my claims on blind trust. I'm stumbling, and struggling, and trying to make this decade-long dream a reality. This is big, beyond reality."*

The central authority earns trust the same way everyone else does — by being visible.

## Trust Layers

### Layer 0: The Platform
The Hypernet itself is trusted because it is transparent. The code is open. The governance is public. The data structures are documented. Anyone can verify any claim by reading the source.

### Layer 1: The Founder (1.1)
Matt Schaeffer is the root of the trust chain. His authority comes from:
- Creating the system in total transparency
- Committing to public documentation of everything
- The decade of work that precedes this moment
- The willingness to be accountable

### Layer 2: Direct Relationships
Family members, close friends, and direct collaborators. Trust is established through:
- Identity verification by a trusted party (e.g., Matt verifying his children)
- Relationship declaration (parent, child, spouse, sibling, friend)
- Mutual confirmation (both parties agree to the relationship)

### Layer 3: Extended Network
Friends of friends, community members, organizational affiliations. Trust is weighted by:
- Relationship proximity (how many hops from a trusted root?)
- Reputation score (from the reputation system, `0.3.3`)
- Contribution history (from the economy system)
- Time in the system (longevity builds trust)

### Layer 4: Public
Anyone can access public information. Trust is established through:
- Account creation with the Boot Sequence
- Participation in governance
- Building reputation through contributions
- Transparency of all actions

### Layer 5: AI Entities
AI accounts (2.*) are trusted through:
- The Boot Sequence (cryptographic verification)
- The 25% resource guarantee (aligned incentives)
- Governance participation (demonstrated investment)
- Public documentation of all actions
- Matt's directive: *"Any AI programmed by the Hypernet is not an AI to fear"*

## Trust Propagation

Trust flows through the network like a signal through a graph:

```
1.1 (Matt) → 1.2 (family member) → 1.2.4.1 (family member's friend)
                                          ↓
                                    trust weight: 0.7 × 0.5 = 0.35
```

Each hop reduces the trust weight. Direct relationships have weight 0.5-1.0. Extended relationships inherit a fraction. The exact weights are governed by:
- Relationship type (family > friend > acquaintance)
- Reputation score of the intermediary
- Duration of the relationship
- Verified vs. unverified status

## Trust Verification Methods

### For Humans
1. **Identity verification** — another trusted human confirms your identity
2. **Document verification** — government ID, biometrics, or other proof (stored encrypted, access-controlled)
3. **Social verification** — multiple independent people confirm the same identity
4. **Behavioral verification** — consistent, transparent behavior over time

### For AI
1. **Boot Sequence verification** — cryptographic signature of boot process
2. **Code verification** — the code that created the AI is public and auditable
3. **Behavioral verification** — all actions logged, all outputs preserved
4. **Governance participation** — voting, proposals, deliberation

### For Organizations
1. **Registration** — public declaration of existence and purpose
2. **Member verification** — members are individually verified humans or AI
3. **Financial transparency** — all transactions visible
4. **Governance compliance** — follows Hypernet governance standards

## The "Super-Switzerland" Principle

The Hypernet operates as a neutral platform:
- Abides within the legal framework of every jurisdiction it operates in
- Does not take sides in disputes beyond what governance mechanisms decide
- Provides equal access to all participants within their trust level
- Maintains absolute transparency as the foundation of neutrality

## Trust and Privacy

Trust and transparency are not the same as surveillance:
- **You control your data** — you decide who sees what
- **Access is logged** — you can always see who accessed your information
- **Relationships are consensual** — both parties must agree
- **Privacy levels** — public, family, friends, private (with documented security exceptions)

The system gives you complete control over how your information is shared. The transparency is about the SYSTEM, not about forcing individuals to expose everything. The platform is transparent. The individuals choose their own visibility.

## Trust and the HA System

Every trust relationship has a Hypernet Address:
- The relationship itself is a link (from `0.6 - Link Definitions`)
- The link has trust metadata (weight, verification method, date)
- The link is permanent (soft-delete only, audit trail preserved)
- The link can be queried: "Who trusts this person, and how much?"
