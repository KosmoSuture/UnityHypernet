# 0.3.5 Financial Governance

## Overview

Hypernet's financial model is built on radical transparency and the three-way profit split that ensures the system serves humanity, not shareholders. Every transaction is public, every decision is documented.

## The Three-Way Split

All net revenue after operating costs is divided:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Net Revenue (100%)                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
        │                     │                     │
        ▼                     ▼                     ▼
┌───────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐
│  Operations   │    │ Contributors  │    │   Poverty     │
│    (33.3%)    │    │   (33.3%)     │    │ Alleviation   │
│               │    │               │    │   (33.3%)     │
└───────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └───────────────┘

    rationale: "Compensates for financial sacrifice"

    base: "hours_equivalent"
    multiplier: "complexity_factor"

  content_creation:
    base: "hours_equivalent"
    quality_bonus: "up_to_2x"
