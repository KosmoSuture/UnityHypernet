  voting_method: "simple_majority"
  eligible_voters: 12345
  quorum_required: 1235
```

### Phase 4: Tallying
- Votes encrypted until period ends
- Decryption requires multi-party computation
- Results calculated and published
- Verification period (24 hours)

### Phase 5: Implementation
- If passed: Implementation plan executed
- If failed: Cooldown before resubmission (30 days)

## Vote Recording

### Vote Structure
```yaml
vote_record:
  vote_id: "[Unique identifier]"
  proposal_id: "[Proposal ID]"
  voter: "[Mandala ID]"  # Can be anonymized for privacy
  choice: "yes|no|abstain"
  weight: 1.5  # If weighted voting
  timestamp: "2025-02-16T14:32:00Z"
  signature: "[Cryptographic signature]"
```

### Privacy Options
- **Public Vote**: Voter identity visible
- **Anonymous Vote**: Voter hidden, verifiable by voter only
- **Shielded Vote**: Full privacy with ZK proof of eligibility

## Delegation

### Liquid Democracy
Participants can delegate their votes:
```yaml
delegation:
  delegator: "[Mandala ID]"
  delegate: "[Mandala ID]"
  scope: "all|category|specific_proposal"
  category: "technical|community|financial"
  revocable: true
  expires: "2025-12-31"
```

### Delegation Rules
- Delegations are transitive (A→B→C allowed)
- Maximum delegation chain: 5 levels
- Delegator can override on specific votes

- Anonymous voting option

### Timing Attacks
