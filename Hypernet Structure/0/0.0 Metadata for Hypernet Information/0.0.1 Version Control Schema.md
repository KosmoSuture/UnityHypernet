# 0.0.1 Version Control Schema

## Overview

Every Object in the Hypernet maintains a complete version history. This ensures transparency, accountability, and the ability to trace the evolution of any piece of information.

## Version Identifier Format

```
[Address]@v[Major].[Minor].[Patch]-[Timestamp]
```

### Example
```
3.1.2.1.001@v1.2.0-20250130T143022Z
```

## Version Types

### Major Versions (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
- Fundamental changes to the object's nature or structure
- Breaking changes to linked objects
- Requires review and approval process

### Minor Versions (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)
- Significant content additions or modifications
- Non-breaking structural changes
- May trigger notifications to linked objects

### Patch Versions (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)
- Corrections, typo fixes, clarifications
- No structural or semantic changes
- Automatic propagation

## Version Metadata

Each version record contains:

```yaml
version_record:
  version_number: "1.2.0"
  timestamp: "2025-01-30T14:30:22Z"
  author: "[Person Object Link]"
  change_type: "minor"
  change_summary: "Brief description of changes"
  change_details: "Detailed changelog"
  previous_version: "1.1.0"
  approval_status: "approved|pending|rejected"
  approver: "[Person Object Link]"
  digital_signature: "[Cryptographic signature]"
```

## Version Access

### Current Version
Default retrieval returns the latest approved version.

### Historical Versions
Any previous version can be accessed via:
```
[Address]@v[VersionNumber]
```

### Version Comparison
The system supports diff operations between any two versions.

## Branching and Merging

For collaborative editing, the system supports:

### Branches
```
[Address]@branch/[branch-name]
```

### Merge Requests
Changes from branches are merged through a review process similar to git pull requests.

## Immutability Guarantee

Once a version is committed:
- The content cannot be altered
- The timestamp is cryptographically verified
- The author attribution is permanent
- The change record is append-only
