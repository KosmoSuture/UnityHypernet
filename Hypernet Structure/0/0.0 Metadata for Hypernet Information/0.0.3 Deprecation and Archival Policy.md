# 0.0.3 Deprecation and Archival Policy

## Overview

In the Hypernet, information is never truly deleted. This policy defines how content transitions through lifecycle states while preserving historical integrity and the immutability of addresses.

## Object Lifecycle States

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ Active  │ ──► │Deprecated│ ──► │ Archived │ ──► │ Preserved│
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘
     │                                                  ▲
     └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    (Direct preservation)
```

### Active
- Default state for all new objects
- Full read/write access (per permissions)
- Indexed in search
- Appears in navigation

### Deprecated
- Marked as outdated or superseded
- Read access maintained
- Write access restricted to corrections only
- Warning displayed on access
- Links to replacement/successor if applicable
- Remains in search with "deprecated" flag

### Archived
- Read-only access
- Removed from primary search (available in archive search)
- May be moved to cold storage
- Reduced replication factor
- Access may require explicit request

### Preserved
- Special state for historically significant content
- Full replication maintained
- Protected from accidental archival
- Curator oversight required for state changes

## Deprecation Process

### Automatic Triggers
- Object not accessed for 5+ years
- Author explicitly marks as deprecated
- Superseded by newer version
- Linked dependencies all deprecated

### Manual Deprecation
```yaml
deprecation_request:
  object_address: "[Address]"
  reason: "superseded|outdated|duplicate|error|other"
  replacement_address: "[New Address]" # if applicable
  requestor: "[Person Object]"
  effective_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

### Review Period
- 90-day notice before deprecation takes effect
- Stakeholders (linked objects' owners) notified
- Appeals accepted during this period

## Archival Process

### Eligibility
- Deprecated for 2+ years
- No active inbound links from non-archived objects
- No access in past 12 months
- Or explicit archival request with justification

### Archival Procedure
1. Final snapshot created
2. Content migrated to archival storage
3. Index entries updated
4. Redirect stub maintained at original address
5. Notification sent to historical access log

## Data Retention Guarantees

### Minimum Retention
- All objects retained minimum 100 years
- System metadata retained indefinitely
- Legal/compliance holds override archival

### Restoration
Any archived object can be restored to active status:
- Requestor must have appropriate permissions
- Content retrieved from archive storage
- Full indexing restored
- Version history preserved

## Historical Access

Archived content remains accessible via:
```
[Address]?archive=true
```

Or through the Archive Search interface at:
```
