# 0.0.2 Address Allocation Protocol

## Overview

This document defines how new addresses are allocated within the Hypernet Library system. Address allocation must balance between:
- Preventing address exhaustion
- Maintaining logical organization
- Enabling decentralized allocation
- Preserving uniqueness guarantees

## Allocation Authority Levels

### Level 1: System Reserved (0.*)
- Allocated by Hypernet Core Governance
- Requires supermajority vote
- Used for fundamental system infrastructure

### Level 2: Top-Level Categories (1-9)
- Pre-defined and fixed
- Cannot be added or modified without protocol upgrade

### Level 3: Subcategories (X.Y.*)
- Allocated by Category Stewards
- Requires proposal and community review
- 30-day comment period before finalization

### Level 4: Instance Addresses (X.Y.Z.*)
- Automatic allocation by system
- Sequential numbering within category
- No human intervention required

## Allocation Request Process

### Step 1: Proposal Submission
```yaml
allocation_request:
  requested_address: "4.7"
  purpose: "Scientific Research Publications"
  justification: "Current categories insufficient for..."
  proposed_schema: "[Link to schema document]"
  requestor: "[Person Object]"
  supporters: ["[Person Object]", "..."]
```

### Step 2: Community Review
- Posted to governance forum
- 14-day discussion period
- Minimum 10 unique commenters required

### Step 3: Technical Review
- Schema compatibility check
- Namespace collision analysis
- Integration impact assessment

### Step 4: Voting
- Open vote to all verified Hypernet members
- Weighted by reputation score
- 60% approval threshold
- 7-day voting window

### Step 5: Implementation
- Address reserved in global registry
- Schema deployed to all nodes
- Documentation published

## Reserved Address Blocks

Certain address ranges are reserved for future expansion:

| Range | Reservation Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|
| X.0.* | Category metadata (always reserved) |
| X.99.* | Emergency/overflow allocation |
| X.Y.0.* | Subcategory metadata |
| *.*.*.0 | Instance metadata/index |

## Collision Prevention

### Global Registry
A distributed registry (replicated across all Cerberus nodes) tracks:
- All allocated addresses
- Pending allocation requests
- Reserved ranges
- Deprecated addresses

### Atomic Allocation
Address allocation is an atomic operation using distributed consensus to prevent race conditions.

## Address Retirement

Addresses are never deleted but can be marked as:
- **Deprecated**: Still accessible but marked for phase-out
- **Archived**: Read-only, historical access only
- **Redirected**: Points to new canonical address
