# 0.0.0 Library Addressing System

## Overview

The Hypernet Library Addressing System provides a universal, hierarchical addressing scheme for organizing all human knowledge, objects, and relationships. Inspired by traditional library classification systems (Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress), it extends the concept to encompass everything—not just books, but people, devices, businesses, concepts, and physical objects.

## Core Principles

### 1. Universal Uniqueness
Every piece of information in the Hypernet has exactly ONE permanent address. Unlike the current internet where data is duplicated trillions of times, Hypernet ensures:
- No duplication of information
- Single source of truth
- Persistent, never-changing addresses

### 2. Hierarchical Organization
Addresses use a decimal notation system that creates natural hierarchies:
```
[Major Category].[Subcategory].[Sub-subcategory].[Instance].[Detail]
```

### 3. Human-Readable Structure
While internally addresses may use more efficient encodings, the human-readable format follows logical, memorable patterns.

## Top-Level Categories

| Address | Category | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | System Metadata | Hypernet infrastructure, schemas, control data |
| 1 | People | Individual persons and their associated data |
| 2 | Groups & Organizations | Non-commercial collectives, communities, governments |
| 3 | Businesses | Commercial entities and their operations |
| 4 | Knowledge | Information, research, education, documentation |
| 5 | Objects | Physical items, devices, products |
| 6 | Media | Audio, video, images, creative works |
| 7 | Events | Time-bound occurrences, meetings, historical events |
| 8 | Locations | Physical and virtual places |
| 9 | Concepts | Abstract ideas, theories, philosophies |

## Address Resolution

### Format
```
[Category].[Subcategory].[Instance].[Component].[Subcomponent]
```

### Example Breakdown
```
3.1.2.1.001
│ │ │ │ └── Instance number (001 = first task)
│ │ │ └──── Status category (1 = Active/Open)
│ │ └────── Component (2 = Task Management System)
│ └──────── Subcategory (1 = Hypernet organization)
└────────── Major category (3 = Businesses)
```

## Addressing Rules

### Rule 1: Immutability
Once assigned, an address NEVER changes. If an object is deprecated, it is marked as such but the address remains reserved.

### Rule 2: Inheritance
Child addresses inherit properties and permissions from parent addresses unless explicitly overridden.

### Rule 3: Cross-Referencing
Objects at any address can link to objects at any other address via Link Objects (defined in 0.6).

### Rule 4: Version Control
Changes to objects create new versions, not new addresses. Version history is maintained at the same address.

## Reserved Address Spaces

| Range | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 0.0.* | Core system metadata |
| 0.1.* | System code (reserved) |
| 0.2.* | Node definitions |
| 0.3.* | Control and governance |
| 0.4.* | Reserved for future use |
| 0.5.* | Master object schemas |
| 0.6.* | Link type definitions |
| 0.7.* | Workflows and processes |
| 0.8.* | Security protocols |
| 0.9.* | System extensions |

## Integration with Objects

Every address points to an Object (see 0.5). The address is stored in the Object's metadata and is used for:
- Retrieval and navigation
- Permission inheritance
- Link endpoints
- Search indexing
- VR spatial positioning
