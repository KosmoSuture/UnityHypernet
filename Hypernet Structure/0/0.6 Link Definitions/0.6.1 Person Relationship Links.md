# 0.6.1 Person Relationship Links

  target_types: ["person"]
  cardinality: "many_to_many"

  properties:
    since: "date"
    context: "how_met"
    strength: "0.0-1.0"

| 0.2-0.4 | Casual | Occasional interaction |
| 0.4-0.6 | Regular | Frequent contact |
| 0.6-0.8 | Close | Strong relationship |
| 0.8-1.0 | Intimate | Very close bond |

## Privacy Considerations

Person links are subject to:
- Both parties can control visibility
- Either party can hide the link from their profile
- Some link types require mutual consent
- Family links may have special legal considerations
