**Why They Need Us:**
- Claude's mission: "AI assistant that's helpful, harmless, and honest"
- Current limitation: Claude doesn't know you personally

Subject: [Company] + Hypernet Partnership Opportunity

Hi [Name],

I'm Matt Schaeffer, CEO of Hypernet. We're building the personal data
infrastructure that [Company Product] needs to deliver deeper personalization.

The challenge: [Company Product] needs personal context (calendar, email,
tasks, etc.) but can't access it ethically or legally.

Our solution: Privacy-first API that gives AI systems access to personal
data with user consent and control.

We've built:
• 61 REST APIs covering 19 data types
• Integrations with 20+ services (Google, Apple, Instagram, etc.)
• GDPR/CCPA compliant by design
• Partnerships forming with [other companies if you can name them]

Would love to discuss how Hypernet could:
1. Make [Company Product] 10x more valuable with personal context
2. Differentiate you vs. [competitor]
3. Unlock new enterprise use cases

Available for a call next week? I can send over a partnership deck.

Best,
Matt

## Partnership Economics

### Revenue Modeling

**Example: Anthropic Partnership**

```
Assumptions:
- Claude has 5M users
- 1% adopt Hypernet integration: 50,000 users
- Average 100 API calls per user per month
- Pricing: $0.05 per API call

Revenue Calculation:
- Monthly calls: 50,000 users × 100 calls = 5M calls
- Monthly revenue: 5M × $0.05 = $250K
- Annual revenue: $250K × 12 = $3M

Year 1: $1M (slow ramp)
Year 2: $3M (full adoption)
Year 3: $6M (50% growth from new users + increased usage)
```

**Example: Salesforce Partnership**

```
Assumptions:
- Target 50 enterprise customers in Year 1
- Average 200 employees per customer
- $50K annual license per 100 employees
- 75% gross margin to Hypernet

Revenue Calculation:
- Year 1: 50 customers × 200 employees × ($50K/100) = $5M gross
- Hypernet share (75%): $3.75M
- Salesforce share (25%): $1.25M

Growth:
Year 1: $3.75M
Year 2: $10M (150 customers)
Year 3: $25M (500 customers)
```

**Total Partnership Revenue Projection:**

```
Year 1 (5 partnerships):
- Anthropic: $1M
- OpenAI: $2M
- Salesforce: $3.75M
- Microsoft: $1M
- Others: $2M
Total: $9.75M

Year 2 (7 partnerships):
- Anthropic: $3M

Total: $70M
```

### Investment Modeling

## Competitive Positioning vs. Partners

### How to Avoid Being Cut Out

**Risk:** Partner builds their own solution and cuts us out

**Mitigations:**

**1. Deep Integration**
- Make it painful to rip out
- Multiple integration points
- User data and preferences tied to us
- Ecosystem lock-in

**2. Multi-Platform Value**
- We connect ALL services, not just one
- Neutrality is our advantage
- They can't replicate without anticompetitive issues

**3. Network Effects**
- More partners = more value
- User has all data in one place
- Switching costs increase over time

**4. Legal Agreements**
- Non-compete clauses (limited scope)
- Long-term contracts
- Termination costs

**5. Speed**
- Move fast, stay ahead technically
- Keep innovating
- By the time they build it, we're 3 years ahead

**6. Brand & Trust**
- Users trust neutral third party
- Privacy brand is defensible
- Hard to replicate user trust

---

**Partnership strategy is critical to success. Benefits:**

**Distribution:**
- 100,000+ users via partnerships
- Zero CAC for those users
- Faster growth than organic

**Revenue:**
- $9M ARR from partnerships in Year 1

- Primary revenue driver

**Validation:**
