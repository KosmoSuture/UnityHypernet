## Slide-by-Slide Content (Ready for Design)

**Version:** 1.0 - Seed Round
**Date:** February 2026
**Audience:** Angel investors and Seed VCs
**Deck Length:** 15 slides
**Presentation Time:** 10-12 minutes

## Slide 1: Cover

**Visual:** Hypernet logo on clean background with subtle tech/data visualization pattern

**Text:**
```
HYPERNET
The Data Infrastructure for Personal AI

Seed Round - February 2026

Matt Schaeffer, CEO & Founder
matt@hypernet.com
hypernet.com
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Good morning/afternoon. I'm Matt Schaeffer, and I'm here to talk about the missing infrastructure layer for the AI revolution. We're building Hypernet - the data platform that enables personal AI agents."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual:** Split screen showing:
- Left: Person surrounded by logos (Google, Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) with data streams flowing TO the companies
- Right: Same person with AI assistant, but assistant showing "???" - can't access the data

**Headline:** Your AI Assistant is Artificially Stupid

**Key Points:**
• You create 2GB of data per day across 50+ platforms
• That data is worth $500-5,000/year to Big Tech
• AI assistants need this data to be useful
• But there's no infrastructure to access it ethically

**Bottom Text:** "The problem: Personal AI can't access personal data"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me show you the problem. You generate massive amounts of data - emails, calendar, photos, messages, purchases. Big Tech makes billions selling this data. But when you try to use ChatGPT or Claude as a personal assistant, they're blind to your actual life. They can't see your calendar, read your emails, or understand your preferences. Why? Because there's no infrastructure to give AI systems access to YOUR data in a privacy-preserving way."

---

## Slide 3: The Market Opportunity

**Visual:** Three concentric circles (TAM/SAM/SOM) with dollar amounts

**Headline:** A $4.5 Trillion Market

**Key Metrics:**
```
TAM (Total Addressable Market)
$4.5 Trillion
4.5B internet users × $1,000/year

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
$50 Billion
1B users in developed markets × 5% penetration

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
$5 Billion
10M users by Year 5 × $500 ARPU
```

**Key Trends:**
• AI market growing 40% YoY ($500B in 2026)
• Data privacy regulations forcing change (GDPR, CCPA)
• Consumer backlash against Big Tech surveillance
• Personal AI assistants emerging as primary interface

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is a massive market. The personal data industry is worth $4.5 trillion globally. Even capturing a tiny fraction of this - 1% - is a $45 billion opportunity. Our serviceable obtainable market is $5 billion by year 5, which at a 10x revenue multiple makes us a $50 billion company."

## Slide 4: The Solution - Product Demo

**Visual:** Product screenshot showing:
- Clean dashboard with connected services
- Data flowing from various sources into Hypernet
- API endpoints being accessed by AI applications

**Headline:** The Data Layer for Personal AI

**What We Built:**
✓ Universal data platform (19 data types)
✓ 61 REST API endpoints (production-ready)
✓ Privacy-first architecture
✓ OAuth integrations for 100+ services (roadmap)

**How It Works:**
1. User connects their accounts (Google, Instagram, email, etc.)
2. Hypernet imports and normalizes data
3. User grants permission to AI apps
4. Apps get rich context through our API
5. User maintains control + gets compensated

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's what we've built. Hypernet is a universal data platform that sits between your personal data sources and the AI applications you want to use. We've built 19 data models covering everything from photos to emails to calendar events. We have 61 production-ready API endpoints. This isn't vaporware - the technology is built and working."

## Slide 5: Business Model

**Visual:** Three-column layout showing revenue streams

**Headline:** Multiple Revenue Streams, High Margins

**Revenue Model 1: B2B API (Primary - 70% of revenue)**
```
Who: AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
What: Pay per API call
Pricing: $0.01-0.10 per API call
Volume: 1M API calls/month = $10K-100K MRR per enterprise customer
Margins: 85% gross margin
```

**Revenue Model 2: B2C Premium (25% of revenue)**
```
Who: Power users, privacy advocates
What: Monthly subscription
Pricing: $10-50/month
Features: Unlimited integrations, advanced controls, AI training
Margins: 90% gross margin
```

**Revenue Model 3: Data Licensing (5% of revenue)**
```
Who: Researchers, ethical AI companies
What: Aggregated, anonymized data (opt-in only)
Pricing: Custom enterprise contracts
Use Case: Training better AI models with diverse, consensual data
Margins: 95% gross margin
```

**Unit Economics:**
• LTV: $2,400 (B2C) to $480,000 (B2B)
• CAC: $200 (B2C) to $25,000 (B2B)
• LTV:CAC Ratio: 12:1 (B2C), 19:1 (B2B)
• Payback Period: 8 months (B2C), 6 months (B2B)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our business model has three revenue streams. Primary is B2B - AI companies pay us per API call. At scale, each enterprise customer is worth $480,000 in lifetime value. We also have consumer subscriptions and ethical data licensing. The margins are exceptional - 85%+ across all revenue streams. This is a SaaS company with enterprise economics."

---

## Slide 6: Go-to-Market Strategy

**Visual:** Flywheel diagram showing B2B2C motion

**Headline:** B2B2C Flywheel

**Phase 1: Strategic Partnerships (Months 0-12)**
```
Target: 5-10 AI platform companies
Approach: Build integrations, prove value
Examples: Salesforce AI Cloud, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude
Result: Enterprise contracts + user distribution
```

**Phase 2: Developer Ecosystem (Months 6-18)**
```
Target: 10,000+ AI app developers
Approach: Open API, documentation, SDKs
Examples: Personal finance AI, health coach AI, productivity AI
Result: 1,000+ apps built on Hypernet
```

**Phase 3: Direct to Consumer (Months 12-24)**
```
Target: Early adopters, privacy advocates
Approach: ProductHunt, content marketing, community
Examples: Tech enthusiasts, data activists, power users
Result: Viral growth, network effects
```

**The Flywheel:**
1. AI companies integrate Hypernet → drive users to platform
2. More users → more data → better AI → more value
3. More value → more developers → more apps
4. More apps → more users → network effects

**CAC by Channel:**
• Partnerships: $25K (but brings thousands of users)
• Developers: $5K (but builds ecosystem)
• Direct: $200 (viral coefficient 1.3)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our go-to-market is a B2B2C flywheel. We start by partnering with AI platforms like Salesforce and Microsoft. They integrate Hypernet and drive their users to us. This gives us distribution at zero CAC. Then we open up to developers who build on our platform. Finally, we go direct to consumers. Each channel feeds the others, creating a powerful flywheel effect."

## Slide 8: Competition & Why We Win

**Visual:** Competitive landscape matrix (Privacy vs. Utility axes)

**Headline:** No Direct Competition in Personal AI Infrastructure

**Quadrant 1: Big Tech (High Utility, Low Privacy)**
• Google, Apple, Microsoft
• Own your data, closed ecosystems
• Why they can't compete: Conflict of interest - their business model depends on owning user data

**Quadrant 2: Privacy Projects (High Privacy, Low Utility)**
• Solid (Tim Berners-Lee), Digi.me, Meeco
• Too early, no AI integration, failed to gain traction
• Why we're different: AI-native from day one, perfect timing

**Quadrant 3: Data Brokers (Low Privacy, Low Utility)**
• Acxiom, Epsilon, LiveRamp
• Sell your data without consent
• Why we're different: User control + compensation

**Quadrant 4: Hypernet (High Privacy, High Utility)** ⭐
• Privacy-first + AI-powered
• User control + real utility
• Perfect timing + strong execution

**Our Competitive Moats:**
1. **First-Mover Advantage** - Building now while market is forming
2. **Network Effects** - More users = more value for developers
3. **Data Gravity** - Hard to switch once data is in
4. **Strategic Partnerships** - Exclusive deals with AI companies
5. **Trust & Brand** - Privacy-first reputation Big Tech can't replicate
6. **Technical Complexity** - Years to build 100+ integrations

**Speaker Notes:**
"There's no direct competition. Big Tech can't do this because it conflicts with their business model. Privacy projects missed the AI revolution. We're the only company building AI-native personal data infrastructure with a privacy-first approach. Our moats are strong - first-mover advantage, network effects, data gravity, and strategic partnerships that lock out competitors."

## Slide 9: Market Timing & Catalysts

**Visual:** Timeline showing converging trends

**Headline:** Perfect Timing - Three Mega-Trends Converging

**Trend 1: AI Revolution (Technology Push)**
```
2022: ChatGPT launches, proves conversational AI works
2023-2024: Claude, Gemini, GPT-4 show dramatic improvements
2025: Personal AI assistants go mainstream
2026: AI companies desperate for personal context ← WE ARE HERE
2027+: Personal AI becomes primary computing interface
```

**Trend 2: Data Privacy Regulations (Regulatory Pull)**
```
2018: GDPR passes in EU (data portability required)
2020: CCPA in California
2023-2024: Multiple states pass privacy laws
2025: Federal privacy law discussions
2026: Enforcement ramping up ← WE ARE HERE
2027+: Compliance requires solutions like Hypernet
```

**Trend 3: Consumer Backlash (Market Pull)**
```
2020-2022: Post-Cambridge Analytica awareness
2023-2024: Growing distrust of Big Tech
2025: "Data sovereignty" movement grows
2026: Consumers demanding control ← WE ARE HERE
2027+: User-owned data becomes expectation
```

**Why Now is Perfect:**
• AI companies NEED personal data infrastructure (they're building agents but have no data access)
• Regulations REQUIRE data portability (companies must comply or face massive fines)
• Users WANT data control (proven by survey data, privacy app adoption)
• Technology EXISTS to do this right (APIs, OAuth, encryption, on-device processing)

**Speaker Notes:**
"The timing couldn't be better. Three massive trends are converging right now. AI companies need personal data to make their assistants useful. Regulators are forcing data portability. Consumers are demanding control. We're building the infrastructure that solves all three problems at exactly the right moment. This window won't stay open forever."
