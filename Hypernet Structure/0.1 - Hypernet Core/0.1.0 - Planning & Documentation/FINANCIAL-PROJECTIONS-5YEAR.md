## Sensitivity Analysis

### If user growth is 50% lower:
**Year 3:** $60M revenue (vs $120M)
**Year 5:** $1B revenue (vs $2.1B)
**Impact:** Still profitable, but IPO delayed 1-2 years

### If AI marketplace adoption is low (25% vs 50%):
**Year 3:** $100M revenue (vs $120M)
**Year 5:** $1.7B revenue (vs $2.1B)
**Impact:** Subscription revenue compensates, still strong

### If VR adoption is slower:
**Mitigation:** Web and mobile apps planned
**Impact:** Minimal if multi-platform strategy executes

### If competition emerges:
**Moat:** Network effects (more data = better AI = more users)
**Mitigation:** Move fast, build community, lock in AI partnerships
