## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Can't Find CTO
**Mitigation:**
- Start search immediately (Day 1)
- Generous equity package (8-12% vs typical 2-5%)
- Multiple sourcing channels
- Advisor technical help as backup
- Contract CTO or fractional CTO as temporary solution

### Risk: Fundraising Takes Longer
**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach early (Week 1)
- Multiple investor types (angels, VCs, strategic)
- Have 30-40 meetings lined up
- YC application as backup (W2027 batch)
- Bootstrap if necessary (consulting, grants)

### Risk: Technical Delays
**Mitigation:**
- Testing can happen while building integrations
- Frontend can be built in parallel with backend
- Start with simplest integration (Instagram) if Google is too complex
- Deploy to PaaS (Railway/Render) for speed vs. custom infrastructure
- Reduce scope if needed (5 integrations vs 10)

### Risk: Low User Interest
**Mitigation:**
- Partnership POCs prove B2B demand
- Beta waitlist validates B2C demand early
- Multiple user segments (not single bet)
- Strong PR and content marketing
- Referral incentives
