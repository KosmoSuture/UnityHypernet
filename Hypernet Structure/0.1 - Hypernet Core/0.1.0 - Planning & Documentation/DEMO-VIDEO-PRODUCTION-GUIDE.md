## Right Now: Next Steps

### Option A: DIY with AI (Recommended for speed)

**Today:**
1. Sign up for Runway ML (runwayml.com)
2. Start generating Scene 1 (test the process)
3. If it works, generate all 19 scenes this weekend

**This Weekend:**
1. Generate all scenes
2. Get voiceover from ElevenLabs
3. Find music

**Next Week:**
1. Edit together
2. Publish
3. Send to investors

### Option B: Hire It Out (Recommended for quality)

**Today:**
1. Post job on Fiverr: "Create 90-second cinematic tech demo video"
2. Attach this storyboard + voiceover script
3. Budget: $1000, deadline: 7 days

**Next Week:**
1. Review drafts
2. Request revisions
3. Approve final
4. Distribute

### Option C: Hybrid (Best of both)

**This Weekend:**
1. Generate a few key scenes with AI (Scenes 9, 10, 12, 16)
2. Test if the look is good enough

**If yes:** Do full DIY
**If no:** Hire pro, provide your AI scenes as reference

---

## My Recommendation

**For Monday investor emails:**
- Don't wait for video
- Send emails without video link
- Say "Demo video coming this week"

**For this weekend:**
- Generate Scene 9 (Entering Hyperspace) with Runway ML
- Generate Scene 10 (Photo Gallery)
- If those look good → Full speed ahead on video
- If not → Hire someone Monday

**Reasoning:**
- You can send 50 emails without video
- Video is for follow-ups and meetings
- Don't let perfect video delay first outreach
- But DO create it this week so you have it by Week 2
