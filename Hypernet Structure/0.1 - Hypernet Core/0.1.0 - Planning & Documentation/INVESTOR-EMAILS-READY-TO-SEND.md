## Email 1-10: VR/AR Investors (Priority Tier 1)

### Email to Boost VC

**To:** team@boost.vc
**Subject:** VR Personal Data OS - Demo on Quest 3

```
Hi Boost VC team,

I'm building Hypernet - a personal data operating system with a VR interface on Meta Quest 3. Think "iOS for your personal data, but in VR."

The problem: Your digital life is scattered across 50+ apps. You have no control, and AI companies train on your data without paying you.

Our solution:
• Unified data layer (every object gets a Hypernet Address)
• Immersive VR interface (see your life in 3D on Quest 3)
• AI marketplace (users get paid when AI companies access their data)

We have a working demo. I'd love to put you in the headset for 15 minutes - it's the best way to understand what we're building.

Raising $500K seed to scale to 100K users in 12 months. Given your focus on VR, I thought this might be up your alley.

Available for a call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email to The VR Fund

**To:** [Find on their website - thevr.fund]
**Subject:** Personal OS in VR - Quest 3 Demo Available

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: What if you could see your entire digital life in VR?

I'm building Hypernet - essentially a personal operating system where the interface is virtual reality. Working demo on Quest 3.

Key insight: VR needs compelling use cases beyond games and social. We're building the productivity layer - unified access to all your personal data (photos, emails, documents, calendar) with AI assistance built in.

Early signals are strong:
• Complete architecture designed (260K+ words documented)
• Working prototype (Quest 3, connects to real data)
• 4 revenue streams (subscription, AI marketplace, enterprise, platform fees)

Raising $500K. Would love to show you the demo if you're interested in VR productivity apps.

15-min call?

### Email to Former Oculus Exec (e.g., Brendan Iribe)

**To:** [Find on LinkedIn]
**Subject:** Building the missing layer for consumer VR

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following your work since the Oculus days. I'm building something I think you'd find interesting.

Hypernet: Personal data OS in VR. The thesis is that VR needs a killer app beyond gaming, and "see your entire digital life in 3D" could be it.

The product:
• Import all your data (photos, emails, calendar, documents)
• Navigate it spatially in Quest 3
• AI assistant with full context
• Users own and control everything

The business:
• Consumer subscription ($10/mo)
• AI companies pay users for data access
• Enterprise data management
• Developer platform

Raising $500K seed. Given your experience building the VR industry, I'd love your feedback. Any chance you'd be open to a 20-min call?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email 11-20: Consumer/Data Investors (Priority Tier 2)

### Email to Union Square Ventures

**To:** [Find on USV website - usv.com]
**Subject:** User-owned data network in VR

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building Hypernet, and I think it aligns perfectly with USV's thesis on user-owned data networks.

The problem: Your data is fragmented (50+ apps), controlled by Big Tech, and AI companies profit from it without compensating you.

Our solution: Unified personal data layer where:
1. You own and control everything
2. AI companies pay YOU for access ($5-50/month passive income)
3. VR interface makes it magical (Quest 3)

This creates a network effect: More users → more data → better AI context → more users want in.

We have a working Quest 3 demo. Raising $500K seed to get to 100K users and $2M ARR in 12 months.

Given USV's focus on user ownership and data networks, I'd love to show you what we're building. 20-min call?

### Email to Initialized Capital

**To:** [Find on initialized.com]
**Subject:** VR + Personal Data = $2T Market

```
Hi [Name],

Quick pitch: We're building Hypernet - think Notion meets Google Photos meets Bloomberg Terminal, but in VR.

The insight: Everyone wants unified personal data, but 2D interfaces suck for it. VR makes it intuitive and beautiful.

Working demo:
• Put on Quest 3
• See your photos, emails, calendar in immersive 3D
• Ask AI: "Show me photos from our vacation last summer"
• It instantly shows them, plus the emails about planning it, plus the calendar events

Traction:
• Complete architecture (fully documented)
• Working prototype (Quest 3)
• Clear path to 4 revenue streams

Raising $500K. Would love 15 minutes to show you the demo.

Available this week?

### Email to Homebrew

**To:** [Find on homebrew.co]
**Subject:** Finally, a VR app normies will actually use

```
Hi [Name],

Most VR apps are games or social. We're building the productivity layer: Hypernet, a personal data OS in VR.

Why it works:
• Everyone has this problem (data fragmentation)
• VR makes it delightful (not just functional)
• Users get paid (AI companies access data, users earn passive income)

Why now:
• Quest 3 = $500, great quality, millions sold
• AI boom = desperate need for personal context data
• Privacy regs = users want control

We have a working Quest 3 demo. It's pretty magical.

Raising $500K to get to 100K users. Given Homebrew's focus on consumer and data, thought you might be interested.

Coffee this week?

## Email 21-30: Angels & Micro VCs

### Email to Naval Ravikant

**To:** [Find on Twitter, DM or email if you can find it]
**Subject:** Users finally owning their data (+ earning from it)

```
Hi Naval,

You've written about users needing to own their data. I'm building the practical implementation: Hypernet.

The pitch:
• Unified personal data layer (everything has a Hypernet Address)
• VR interface (Quest 3) for navigation
• AI marketplace: Companies pay users $5-50/mo for data access

This flips the script: Instead of users being the product, users GET PAID.

Early prototype is working. Raising $500K to scale.

I know your time is limited, but if you're interested in user data ownership, I'd love 15 minutes to show you the demo.

Worth a look?

### Email to Balaji Srinivasan

**To:** [Twitter DM or email]
**Subject:** Data sovereignty in VR

```
Balaji,

Big fan of your work on data sovereignty. Building Hypernet - a personal data OS where users control everything and AI companies pay for access.

Key principles:
• User ownership (data stored locally or user's cloud choice)
• Cryptographic addressing (every object gets a Hypernet Address)
• AI access marketplace (transparent, user-controlled, compensated)
• VR interface (Quest 3) as the native UI

This is the sovereignty stack you've talked about, implemented practically.

Working demo available. Raising $500K seed.

Any interest in a quick call?
