## Pro Tips for Better Results

### Tip 1: Upscale After Generation
- Runway has "Upscale to 4K" option
- Use it on Scenes 3, 9, 10, 12, 16 (the hero shots)
- Makes them cinema-quality
- Costs extra credits but worth it

### Tip 2: Generate Multiple Versions
- For key scenes (9, 10, 12, 16), generate 2-3 variations
- Pick the best one
- Gives you options

### Tip 3: Motion Settings Matter
- "Slow dramatic" = Scene 2, 7, 17
- "Fast energetic" = Scene 1, 11
- "Smooth gliding" = Scene 9, 10, 13
- "Static" = Scene 15, 18, 19

### Tip 4: If a Scene Doesn't Work
- Try adding: "cinematic, photorealistic, 8K"
- Try removing details (simpler = better sometimes)
- Try changing lighting: "dramatic lighting" or "soft lighting"
- Try different aspect ratio (16:9 vs 9:16 vs 1:1)

## Troubleshooting

### Scene looks cartoonish/not realistic
**Fix:** Add to prompt: "photorealistic, shot on ARRI Alexa, film grain, practical effects"

### Motion is wrong/janky
**Fix:** Regenerate with clearer camera motion description: "smooth dolly forward at constant speed"

### Scene is too dark/bright
**Fix:** Add lighting description: "professional studio lighting, properly exposed"

### Elements look wrong (Quest 3 looks weird, etc.)
**Fix:** Add: "accurate product design, real-world reference, product photography"

### Scene doesn't match others (style inconsistency)
**Fix:** Add to all prompts: "cinematic sci-fi style, consistent with Blade Runner 2049 and TRON Legacy aesthetic"
