\<\<\<\<For those proofreading/helping\>\>\>\>\>\>

First, thanks for helping.  This is a huge project and I appreciate every little bit of help I can get.  I apologize for my disorganized approach.  It’s going to be like like watching a torrent download.  Pieces all over, but it starts getting sharper and sharper.  I’ve been designing this in my head for a couple years now, so it’s putting out the blueprint for a city.  It’s going to take a little while to really see the resolution.  And sometimes I think of new things it’s capable of that I need in the document, so I skip all over the place.  With that in mind, feel free to ask any questions or ask for clarity on any point and I’ll expand that section more.

I’m going to use some color coding, because there are a number of different audiences that need to be addressed, and I’m not sure how to best split it up.

Architecture type information will be in blue.  It is the more technical side that would be in patents, and used as a basis for starting the program

Red is for those reading the rough draft or places I need input, changes, or etc.

OS and UI developers are green.  This would be for when I’m describing how you would program against the Hypernet

Other colors as needed.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Unified systems.  The strengths and inevitability, as well as the pitfalls and how we plan to build one.

We are moving towards a unified global.  Everyone knows it and everyone is trying to build it.  Companies are trying to be the single source for all your computing needs.  Google is not only search, but a full document search, email, telephone, Artificial intelligence expert, and more.  Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are creating single sign on portals where entire corporations can use their services, as well as identify themselves.  There is an inevitable convergence on a unified system, and everyone wants to be that system. [^1]There are a number of reasons that a unified global system is needed.

1. Duplication of files.  Current information system are starting to converge on shared models, but even many of the shared models people download copies of the files.  One group collaborating through email can generate dozens or hundreds of copies spread between all the collaborators.  Photos and videos shared are copied to the websites that use them, the social sites they use, or the friends or family who download them.  Popular files can be downloaded up to millions of different times.  This is a tremendous amount of duplication,[^2] as much as 25-30% or more.[^3]  A unified system has a unique address for all data, so you don’t need to copy the data.  Everyone views it from the original source with only local caching happening for performance.  
2. This massive copying of data from the source contributor is a prime source of today’s problems with “fake news”.  Even if a viral meme is proven false, it spreads faster than it can be stamped out.  In a unified system, everyone views the meme from the source, and if it’s flagged as false, everyone coming to view it immediately sees that it’s false.  A unified internet can completely stamp out “fake news” and immediately halt viral spreads of fake data.  
3. Numerous applications to learn.  We spend our days learning new applications.  From your operating system, to office suite, email, web browser, special programs you use at work, your social media applications, every piece of electronics you buy.  Every one of them has a learning curve and we waste tremendous amounts of time.  And not all of your friends use the same media applications or pay sites.  And every new application that comes out needs to be learned as well.  There are roughly between 2.2M and 2.8M apps one has access to at any given moment of time.[^4]  A unified platform simplifies everything into a single interface for all devices, programs, websites, and more.  It creates a single system that needs to be learned and allows people to save time by putting 100% of their time into learning one system instead of dividing it between many different applications.  On average, people are spending 5 hours a day on mobile apps[^5], and 135 minutes a day on social media[^6].    
4. Collaboration of all human data in one place.  Instead of fragmented bits of data spread out in so many different ways, a unified platform would let everyone consolidate all information into one place.  Using crowdsourcing a unified system could  build a massive pyramid of knowledge one brick at a time by billions of people worldwide  
5. A framework for storing all this information allows people to collaborate together to increase the worlds knowledge instead of building them in so many different systems.  Researchers who are doing similar studies could find and collaborate to make each of their studies more effective, people   
6. People could connect in new ways.  Get matched with people worldwide for romance, friendship, and more.  They could be alerted of people around them in public who share similar interests, giving them conversation starters that are about topics they are passionate about.  
7. People’s reputations follow them.  Unlike today’s many different police systems that are just starting to integrate, and most of which aren’t available to the public.  If a man commits rape, and crosses a state line and goes to a bar the next night, no current system could help anyone at the bar that night, while a unified system would allow the woman to file a report immediately and send it to the police, where the user could be flagged as being charged of a crime within minutes.  The ease to look up public information about people could be a strong deterrent against crime  
8. Equalizer of corporations and individuals.  By putting together all information weighted only by how useful or “liked”, it individuals, farmers, or craftsmen can sell items on the small scale on equal terms with companies like Amazon.  It could allow much shorter supply chains by putting people producing more in touch with the people buying and reduce the need of middle men in the supply chain  
9. Voting systems.  In a unified system where there was an enforced and punished method to prevent fake accounts, voting systems could easily be built that allowed for near 100% reliability with voter fraud being impossible.    
10. Savings of time  
11. Searching geographical data  
12. Security profile.  With only only a single product online, we can expend our complete resources on keeping that one system secure.  And with an open source product that is open to scrutiny by the world, the response time to vulnerabilities could be near instant (especially with AIs working on it).  A vulnerability is found, the open source nature allows the community to work on the fix as a whole (or AI, checked off by humans), it can be pushed out to QA to test, then the updates pushed down through the system

To build a unified platform, we come to some obstacles that are difficult to overcome with today’s traditional businesses or business models.  To provide a reliable platform for information with reliable fact checking, there needs to be ways to track data back to its source, but also to protect people’s information and privacy.  This is a serious concern regarding traditional businesses.

1. Privacy can be broken down into a couple areas  
   1. Personal privacy of information contained in their databases.  Who has access to see it and change information?  Who is selling your data to whom or how are advertisers getting your information?  Companies can and have.[^7]    
   2. Even if a company promises to protect your data, it could change at any time, and if you don’t approve of those changes, your only choice may be to quit using their service.[^8]  
   3. Even if a company starts with good intentions, future people who run the company can change the policies.  A traditional greed based corporation will have a difficult time convincing consumers to trust them with literally every piece of data there is about you.  
   4. Who is the authority when it comes to fake news?  Most corporations building such a system would inevitably give in to censorship with time, and if a unified system ever censors information under the guise of “fake news” or other.  How can you stop such a company that owns all the world's data?  

There are also serious questions posed for anyone building such a system.

1. How do you uniquely identify people while still providing them as much anonymity as possible?  
2. What safeguards can be built in to prevent censorship or corruption?  How can you ensure that these safeguards can protect the system for hundreds, or possibly thousands of years.  
3. How do you build a system that is beneficial to law enforcement while guaranteeing people’s rights to privacy?  How to you ensure that the system can provide privacy, without being corrupted?

Why we are unique?

We work together.

# \<\<\<\<Going over this.  I don’t know how much of this I'm keeping or whacking.  I think I’ll keep a lot, but it will be used in a description of the product.\>\>\>\>\> Global and Multi Language unification platform {#<<<<going-over-this.-i-don’t-know-how-much-of-this-i'm-keeping-or-whacking.-i-think-i’ll-keep-a-lot,-but-it-will-be-used-in-a-description-of-the-product.>>>>>-global-and-multi-language-unification-platform}

The Hypernet will be a global, Multi Language platform from the start.  Everyone globally sees the exact same information, but in their language.  All information, devices, people, and objects in the world can be unified worldwide system.  This simplifies working together while preventing redundancy in information or efforts.  It encourages global collaboration on unified free or open source projects, or unified research and more efficient uses of funds and resources, as well as immediate peer review.

### Merges reality, internet, and geolocation. {#merges-reality,-internet,-and-geolocation.}

The Hypernet was built from the ground up to be a visualized 3d system natural to virtual reality and geolocation.  It brings the internet search into the real world in all new ways.  It lets users search for books, pictures, videos, information, products, or more based on physical location or time/date.   With virtual reality, it can add a layer of data to every person, place, or thing you experience in life.

### New generation of operating systems. {#new-generation-of-operating-systems.}

The Hypernet is not an operating system incorporating VR, nor do we plan on building one, but the Hypernet with its vast library and novel data structure make the virtual reality computer systems in sci-fi shows an immediate reality.  We hope to give Oculus, Google Glass, Playstation, Microsoft and others a platform where they can improve their products beyond their best current plans on an open platform on the same footing.  They can compete with each other to create the most mind blowing systems, or collaborate together in the Hypernet to make development faster and more efficient.  The first generation of VR interfaces built will able to meet or exceed the capabilities of futuristic computers in the movies.

### Open Source {#open-source}

The Hypernet and all code and even the company itself will be completely open source and can be contributed to by anyone.  In addition, the community will have full access and input to every step of the development chain, including management.  We strive to push openness to its extreme.

### Crowdsource {#crowdsource}

Every aspect of the company and the Hypernet will be crowdsourced in an attempt to bring the most accurate information weighed by expert opinion and community involvement.  We offer new tools to community that improve crowdsource content.  We give the control to the people to make informed decisions and vote weighted by visible expert opinion.

### No central management.  Built for self-organization and self-control. {#no-central-management.-built-for-self-organization-and-self-control.}

Although I will lead the initial charge, the ultimate goal is to make Unity a self-governing entity subject to the will of the people in every way.  Unity Hypernet will never be “owned” in the traditional sense by any individual, company, or government.  It will reflect the will of the people with funds earned being directed by the will of the people to their best use.  Unity will be a trust for the people of planet Earth, to help the people of earth based on their needs.

### Transparent {#transparent}

Unity will take transparency to an extreme.   Every line of code and every piece of the Hypernet will be visible to the public.  Every aspect of the business and every decision made is done with full transparency.  We default to the position that everything should be public in every way with the only exceptions being information that harms the security or integrity of the database.  This would be such things as passwords, private encryption keys.  All communications with the company will be public and visible making government back doors or corporate sellouts impossible.  Every decision made from the company down to the people who implement will be transparent.

Then, Unity takes that extreme level of transparency and changes it from the liability it would be today and turns it into a significant strength.  We leverage it to give the world the ability to suggest better ways to do business or improve any aspect of the company processes.  Imagine working somewhere that any project you are assigned could have hundreds or thousands of people examining the same information you do.  Imagine being able to always pull up a list of the top rated community suggestions for any type of work you need to do.  Or better yet, starting a task assigned to you and having people volunteer to do the job for you in order to get “shares” of the employee profit sharing plan.  Or having an order come down the chain for computer equipment, and by the time it reaches your inbox, multiple vendors already have competitive bids in for your hardware with all paperwork completed for you by the vendor in the company format to save you time just to sweeten the deal.

### Complete customer privacy {#complete-customer-privacy}

Unity takes customer privacy to the same extremes as everything else in the company.  The only person that can view a customers data is the customer and anyone they have given access to through a personal key, or mandala.  Although we respect the right of law enforcement and want to help them do their job, even the process for police warrants is public.  If the police want access, they need to follow a public process that doesn’t have human intervention and allows the community to decide if the police have sufficient evidence to force the system to turn over data to them.  Unity will do the absolute best it can to always protect user data at all costs while maintaining the rights of the community.  As a firm believer in the right to privacy ourselves, we have approached this with the “Golden Rule” as a standard.  Within the limitations of a next generation AI driven global database of immense power, what is the absolute most we can do to protect users and their data.  If we were in your shoes and needed to trust our data to a global corporate giant with a near omniscient database that can’t help but invade privacy by making public data easier to find, what would we want?  If we had a magic lamp and could have any profile privacy wish granted that didn’t break inviolable rules for integrity, trust, and reliability, what would we wish for?  We wished and planned long and hard on this until we had a complete platform for the Hypernet that included encrypted profiles accessible only to the user.  A fortified gatekeeper that handles all access to user accounts.  Only the gatekeeper can access profiles and it won’t break the rules for anyone.  An alias system allows strong and flexible anonymity while still providing consequences for spreading “fake news” or other issues that follow them to their prime profile without revealing their identities.  We protect against abuse power of any sort by giving the entire world equal power without exception and using the world community to make decisions that reflect the will of the people, and we put every decision of any level of importance through our community checks.  We aren’t just trying to protect your data today, or this decade or even century.  Unity’s passion for privacy and freedom was the drive for extremism and perfection that will protect it for thousands of years.  

### Crowdsourced data integrity {#crowdsourced-data-integrity}

The Hypernet has a unique system for crowdsourcing data integrity.  It allows any data to be flagged as suspect, which immediately creates environments for that node for informed debate and discussion linked to outside sources of evidence that gives more visibility and weight to the opinions of those deemed by their communities to be skilled.  The reputation system prevents trolls, personal attacks, and other issues that break down reasoned discussion.  As online reputation drops, users visibility drops to the point of near invisibility or having all posts flagged as immediate possible spam/”fake news”/trolling, etc.  When discussion is finished, the community votes, again, weighed by expert opinion.  We feel that an online community with visible expert opinion, forums, links to evidence, and novel ways to weigh and view both sides is the best possible way to come to the truth in a truly democratic system

### New breed of (safe) organic Artificial Intelligence. {#new-breed-of-(safe)-organic-artificial-intelligence.}

One of the hypernets greatest strengths comes from its unique blend of database and Artificial Intelligence.  Rather than a standard AI designed for a single purpose, the Hypernet creates a blank template to build customized neural networks.  Every user can contribute to adding information, and every user leverage any public data or networks and make them more useful.  In essence, every piece of data worth entering, and every like, or useful page marked, every search completed represents that person and their likes and dislikes and what is important to them personally.  This Ulti-Flex AI represents the sum total of all people.  No matter how powerful it becomes, it cannot turn against us in an end of the world Skynet scenario because it IS us.  It is the sum of the human race in every object and link and can only do what we ask of it.

This new type of AI also gives a safe platform to utilize today’s powerful single purpose AIs.  A language translating AI could be used to automatically translate any new Object created into every known language immediately on post.  It could be applied to real time conversations in groups to provide translations to travelers.

\<here I want to do some comparisons of numbers of nodes between current AIs and what I’m building to show the massively larger scale and capabilities.  I want to demonstrate mathematically that you could store every possible AI in existence in the framework of Unity in an attempt to show how much bigger this is\>

## Intro2-Platform of Reuse, recursion, and efficiency {#intro2-platform-of-reuse,-recursion,-and-efficiency}

## 

## The basic building blocks {#the-basic-building-blocks}

At the root of the design is the concept that raw data is pure and discrete, but it’s the relationships that give the data meaning, and social input that can help find the best data.  Thus our model works much like the brain, where each bit of data is like a neuron, and links are like synapses that link data together and give it meaning.  These links are strengthened by user input giving an organically trained neural network.

There are few databases in the world that can work with data at this level.  Graph databases are simple, but not powerful enough.  \<more on this similar to Kantabutras paper\>.  The most similar database on the market today is V Kantabutra’s Intentionally Linked Entities database **\<citation\>**.  In fact, the root of these two ideas are similar enough they may be able to be integrated.

# Terminology and the building blocks {#terminology-and-the-building-blocks}

In this section, I’ll start with terminology and then move on to how the system will be built.

Terms:

Locker \<possibly new word\>:  A locker is a location to assign various bits of data to ease sharing.  For example, if you were job hunting, you might make a locker where you shared out name, address, and all the other info you give potential employers.  

Mandala: A customized key for giving access to data.  It can have expirations and is usually made for particular lockers, but can be customized to give access to anything.  It is the primary building block for security.

Bubble-object \<needs new word\>: A representation of a data node in the 3d space.  It represents an object that can be interacted with.  It is more than just the node of data, it is how you interact with the data.  The bubble-object would be what you see and touch.

## Objects:

An object is the simplest representation of data and represents a single idea, person, object, or device.  It is the raw and pure data that best represents that concept.  With the Hypernet, an object is a completely self contained and discrete bit of data.  It contains all information about itself, including Links, which I’ll talk about later.

An object contains a number of elements and will be an extended markup type language (I haven’t decided yet if existing markups work or if I’ll need to modify a little to fit what I’m done).  It starts with a header, that is much like the extended data fields on a file, like data/time, created by, modified by, etc.  All objects have a standard header that is common to all objects, then at the end, it specifies the extended xml for that particular type of data.  It does require a separate extended xml file for each data type, but that’s not different than Windows keeping track of how to handle files in the registry, and it gives finer control.  Here is a basic framework for the basic xml for all objects.  All data in the primary field is stored together.  The XML template is downloaded from the template library, and the values for the fields are sent by the computer storing the data.  It sends both the standard header values and all extended values, followed by the data payload.  The receiving computer then loads those values into memory

| Data type-friendly name | Friendly name like “pics, video, person, etc”.  It will be semi-standardized |

| modified by | xxx.xxx.xxx The last person to modify.  When this becomes more than one person, a subnode will be created that contains a list of modifiers. |
| Geoloc | This will be a geo-loc.  Haven’t decided on formats.  It needs to represent single points as well as areas.  I don’t know if I can do that in one field or if I’ll need another one.   |

Once the initial XML file is loaded, the system will then go to the library location for the extended template for the type and load it and match values to what the sending server sent.

The OS would predictively grab links downstream and place more and more info

\<more later, but moving on.

	Description

	Type of objects (i.e. template level)

		Permissions node: This is a special subnode that contains all the permissions information.

		History node: No specific plans other than historical data will go here.  Past versions are tracked and/or stored here.

		Like-objects:  This is a special type of object that may be treated differently.  It allows you to assign like-objects together to do queries,

		Multi-objects- links to other objects

		Standard object:  The default wiki-like web-like interface people see when browsing or creating a new page.  

		Discussions/voting object: Special subnode for removing fake news or voting and more.

		Database objects: a way to store a database table.

## Links

	Description

	Type of links (i.e. template level)

		Multi-links

		Genealogy links

			Parent/child.  \<will contain as it’s primary fields

		Basic Link.  Sometimes all you need is a link with no extra information.  For example, a master node to let you link together a bunch of similar nodes.  This is the simplest link type.

## Overlays: 

 Overlays are a way of overlaying default information with your own.  Essentially you make a copy of the parts of the XML that are being overridden locally, and any value that is different in the local side has the local value.  So if a user clicks on a bubble-object in the interface and moves it in 3d space, the system downloads a copy of the core XML file and copies a blank version to the users overlay library, which is essentially an empty tree structure that mirrors the Hypernet.  When the system requests a node, it also looks for a custom data file in the overlays node.  If it finds one, it loads it up and “overlays” the data from the node, so now the UI location field would show the user defined field and it would pop up in the last place the user put it. 

If a user was browsing a page and wanted to link a page of their own personal notes to that page, they could create a node of any type and move it to the location, and link it to the original.  The system would do this by creating a multi-node on the user side, whose first element is the original link (exempt from overlay to prevent loops) and the second object in the multi-link would be the user created node with their custom information in the location they created it.  an overlay and replace the location address for the original page with a multi-object link on the overlay.  The

## Templates {#templates}

Template types that will be part of the OS.  talk about how the official templates are all stored in a master library and those templates are “safe”.  Any company or designer can create their own templates, but they have to store them on their segment of the hypernet and are “unsafe”.  If a template reaches a certain popularity and other conditions are met, that template can be included into the official library.

One of the places where the Hypernet differs from any known database on the market \<do some research to make sure that no other databases use user input to “train” their search engines\>.  Although ILE databases are very powerful, they, and all other databases start to become inefficient when searching through thousands of similar documents. 

We choose to take a simple approach and use crowdsourcing to create an organic algorithm similar to a “like” system.  When users find the information that is relevant, they “like” it and that link is strengthened.  Thus crowdsourcing can be used to “train” the network on the best matches.  These “likes” are weighed by expert opinion and are difficult to “buy” as it will be nearly impossible to create bots for reasons we’ll get into later.

## Profiles {#profiles}

### Significant thought has been put into the profile system, and it is build with the following concepts in mind: {#significant-thought-has-been-put-into-the-profile-system,-and-it-is-build-with-the-following-concepts-in-mind:}

1) Protect User data.  Unity chooses to take extreme steps in protecting user data.  By default, a user profile and all data it contains are only visible to the user, with the exception of the data Unity stores on it’s side about the user, including all technical support notes.  The users will have full visibility into what data people can see.  If a Unity support person needs access to other areas, the user needs to provide a key \<mandala\> to the support person to access those files.  More on this later.  
2) Ensure the integrity of the profiles.  There is only one account per user.  Any account with access to leave a mark needs to provide evidence of who they are.  Methods will be used including government IDs, biometrics, or other verification covered later.  Punishment for violating the one-account-per-person rule receives HARSH penalties.  
3) Protect User Identity.  To make up for the draconian one account per person rule, Unity protects users identities with a robust alias system that gives them detailed control of what others can see.

### Profiles will be in a tree structure with the following format.  More sections will be added as this develops. \<Also, this might be re-organized.  Most of this is just rough concept at this point and needs to be fleshed out a little. {#profiles-will-be-in-a-tree-structure-with-the-following-format.-more-sections-will-be-added-as-this-develops.-<also,-this-might-be-re-organized.-most-of-this-is-just-rough-concept-at-this-point-and-needs-to-be-fleshed-out-a-little.}

#### *Personal Information.* {#personal-information.}

This will include phone numbers, addresses, etc.

#### *Family information* {#family-information}

This isn’t fleshed out yet, but I want something that helps connect people to their families.  When you click on it, you’d see your parents, siblings, children, maybe even pets.  This would be where you communicate and keep up with family.

### Social Media {#social-media}

Facebook, and Etc.

Will partially be merged with communications.  For example, messages you get in Facebook will show up in Messaging, but you can also get them on the Social Media side as well.  The master node that links down to the subnode that links the individual services would contain your Facebook account under it \<for UP (Unity Programmers), when the Facebook credentials are added, a node is created of the template “Facebook”.  That node would contain everything needed to connect to Facebook through the API.  Then that node would be linked with just a basic link.

#### *Messaging and communications*

This would be the central hub for all communications.  Email, fax, skype, everything.  When you give it your email account, a bubble-icon\<I really need a good name for these.  I want people visualizing everything in 3-d\> would appear and it you could use your email.  Same with Skype, whatsapp, texting and other messaging.  After all your accounts are added, entering this “room” \<Same thing here.  I need a name for the nodes.  These primary nodes off the account are special and would have special features not found elsewhere\> will put you in front of a console that combines all of your messages into one view. \< From a technical perspective, this “console” will be a multi-node object that brings up the node that is the console, as well as opening the primary nodes that represent all the communications methods they have, as well as alerts, and other data.  The way data is centralized into one point is by creating a master node that links to all the ways they message.  When the console is opened, it may pull up the last week of communications.

 \<An example of how the OS would be programmed to use the Hypernet.  \<\<\<\<\<this needs to be moved because it’s unrelated.  Towards the end after describing the profiles, or probably it’s own section\>\>\>\>\>\>

A programmer creating an UI or OS to run this would log the user in.  On login, the program would request the users unique number and present their key for access as that user.  The API would return the primary node, which will return as a multi node object.  You would read the list of nodes and their physical locations in 3d and load them into memory, along with the “icons” for each of those nodes.  In program, you then assign those icons into the 3d location specified.  Then you send requests for the 

3 party keys and rotating encryption keys.

### 3 Key Rotating Encryption.

The hypernet will use a 3 key rotating encryption between all servers.  The encryption will change frequently based on algorithms to balance the load created by generating new keys 

Each communication channel, or app, or etc,  uses the public key from the computer it is talking to, combined with the private key for that particular service or app, and then the master key for that individual or organization.  The master key will be guarded by Cerberus, in the case of users, or one of his henchmen to be announced.

Files will all be encrypted as well.  The system will regularly move data from one server to another, for a number of reasons.  1\) Security, 2\) Maintenance and upkeep, 3\) backup purposes.

1) Security.  Each time the file changes locations, it will be re-encrypted with all new keys making it more difficult to get the files.  In addition, no one knows what server the data is on except for the gatekeeper, so it’s difficult to steal copies of the data even if you knew what you were looking for.  
2) Maintenance and upkeep.  Servers will regularly copy nodes.  This way it is regularly checking

). The master node sends a query for the last week of messages down (which would be a Unity API call to each particular vendor) and sends them up to the master, which builds the data into the table used to consolidate\>.  Each message is a bubble-icon so you know where it came from.  In this system, a voicemail is treated exactly the same as a text, email, or even a recorded skype call.  They are all represented by bubble icons that can be represented in a myriad of different ways by the design team for the 3d OSes that will run this (think mac vs PC).  But at a minimum, when you click on a bubble-icon that represents a communication, it will check the template to see what type of communication it is and open it appropriately in the UI (again, this is something the OS manufacturers will determine exactly how it’s displayed\>

This would be the start for all things multimedia.  It would have all your music, your videos, your pictures, etc.  With the way data is linked in the Hypernet, it’s easy to display them any way you want.  Any licenses for movies or music would be stored with it.

#### *Documents* {#documents}

### Lockers and Mandalas

## Alias system {#alias-system}

The alias system gives people anonymity, but also provides credibility.  At its simplest, it allows you to copy any or all of your main profile to an alias.  The reputation could be adjusted to the alias.  Each alias is a blank copy of your regular alias.  Each piece of data can either be linked from your profile (which is then flagged as legitimate), or it is created for that profile  The flagging would probably be color coded.

Here are some examples of how it would work:

### Professional alias {#professional-alias}

In this alias, it would keep your full name, add on a title, if desired.  It wouldn’t show home address, but would show business.  It might show that you are married with children, but not have their names, or might not include them.  Reputation would be dialed up to 100% so full reputation goes back to your account.  Schools or other professional information would be visible

### Fantasy Roleplay Alias {#fantasy-roleplay-alias}

Absolutely no real information would be carried over.  You would make up a name, likes, dislikes, etc.  Reputation would be dialed to 0% and all reputation earned as that alias stays with that alias.

### Public Friendly Alias {#public-friendly-alias}

You might have your first name, some pictures, general information about yourself, and some of your likes/dislikes listed that are topics you like to talk about.  Your “I want to meet” flag would be on, allowing the system to automatically link you up with others who want to meet.  There would be a number of other flags including ones to indicate wanting to date, and etc.  More on the matchup system later.  Reputation might be set to 50%

### Anonymous Alias. {#anonymous-alias.}

This one would give little or no information.  Flags to meet others would be turned off

## Reputation system {#reputation-system}

Any rule that needs to be enforced needs a punishment \<research.  There are some great studies on this\>.  We choose to do this with a reputation system.  If a person spreads “fake news”, even as an anonymous account, when it’s flagged, that fake news gets attached to their main account.  Once a person has been flagged a few times, future postings similar will be flagged as suspicious from the start.

# Systems and Operations.

## Patching and Updating

### Patch is created and pushed out to the master node.

The patch is sent to the master node using a secure patching method that only allows the patch to come from one particular computer (with backups).  Once the node receives the patch, the node goes into patching mode.

### Node Patching Mode

First the node internally alerts that it is going into patching mode.  The servers all wrap up copy jobs that they are doing that are non critical and they determine the patching order.  All the servers will check in to figure out how they can help and between them they will determine the optimal patch order, as well as how many computers can be spared given capacity needed in case of failure. 

Next, the servers will activate one or more hot spares they start the upgrade process.

While those servers are upgrading, the original pool starts evacuating data from as many computers as they can (keep in mind there are hot spares that won’t be upgraded until the end) and load up the rest until they are full.)  As it empties servers, they check in and start the upgrade process.

 When a server finishes the upgrade, it will check in that it’s finished, and the original pool of servers will start copying their data into the new pool formed by the newly upgraded computers.  As each bit of data is transferred from a server on the old version to a server on the new version, it is individually checked for for compatibility with the new version.  Likely at the same time, it could do the equivalent of a virus scan, or any other large scale sweep of information for violation of rules or content.

This process of emptying computers, upgrading them, moving them to the new pool, and copying data continues until all servers have been upgraded except for the hot spares.  The new pool sets aside a new set of hot spares and then the old set upgrades itself and adds itself to the pool.

The final step is that the pool rebalances itself and finishes any cleanup tasks and checks in as finished.  It then tells all the subnodes below it that they need to upgrade, and the process repeats.

After all the final nodes have been upgraded in the official Unity backbone nodes, the master upgrade node goes to phase 2 to upgrade everything else.  There may be a wait period just to make sure everything is running well before it goes public, but I haven’t decided yet.  The master node sends an public upgrade command to all nodes under it.

Since all the master nodes have already been upgraded, they will mostly pass on the request to their subnodes without further action.  When it reaches the first public node, the process changes only slightly in that the public nodes will send the upgrade process and pretty much every computer on earth will upgrade at once.  There can be some staggering if desired and companies will have control over the upgrade cycle to an extent, although anything longer than a week out would invalidate the servers on the network.  There is little tolerance for not upgrading, especially if we make it so easy.

## Building and maintaining systems for Unity.

The Hypernet will be simple to build and fix systems for.  Because the Hypernet works more like swarm, all servers can be generic and preloaded with the Server OS by the manufacturer.  The Hypernet will run with a set type of calls to drivers by the manufacturer, and then the device responds.  \<\<\<this next part needs to be a section of its own.  Don’t let me forget\!\>\>\>\>  There will be 4 partitions on the disk.  1\)  The Hypernet image, which will be identical for all computers.  This allows us to keep infections out of the main software.  2\) The drivers and files necessary for the computer to operate. 3\) the actual database files being stored, and 4\) temp and local files the system uses.  We will want these partitions to be able to change size dynamically.   \<\<\<\<\<end of part that needs to be a new section\>\>\>\>\>\>

When the computer is started, it checks in with the company that made it and sees who it’s new owner is.  It then follows the PO back to your company (yes, even doing this, it uses mandalas assigned during the purchase order to give it, and only it access to check in).  Then, once it gets into the company, it checks the PO to find out where it’s supposed to be assigned, and it jumps out into the proper pool.  So when the technician plugs it into its designated spot, it configures itself 100% and is working in the pool within seconds of it’s first full boot.

##   General Systems Maintenance.

There is no maintenance to do.  The system self maintains and keeps itself in optimal shape just in normal operations

## Backups.

Backups are done during regular operations.  Any time that a piece of data is copied from one server to another, it checks the last backup date on the tag and backs it up.  More than likely the majority of data will be backed up at the time of update, and the maintenance backups will just be a fallback.

If a piece of data is updated or needs to be backed up for any reason, it goes to the backup server, tells it that a particular piece or block of data needs to be backed up, and the backup server will just go through the list of backup requests and take care of them individually. 

The backup server takes each request, compares it to the last backup and creates a new backup (although I’m not sure of the exact format, I’m leaning towards it creating the original, then the next backup it finds the delta and saves it, but also saves the backed up file whole.  Then when the next backup request comes, it discards the old full, replaces it with the delta from the same backup, and creates a new full.

People would be able to easily do their own file restores (if they have permission) just by going to the folder or file and choosing a restore option.  That would then flag them options that would talk to the backup server and request the files back.  The entire thing would be self serve and entire backup teams could be reduced to single individuals or no one at all.

This also means that technicians that do IT only have to be certified in Unity Hypernet.  Gone are the days of spending thousands of dollars on classes to only specialize in three or four specificities, Unity seeks to open IT to anyone with the aptitude to work in the field, and to do all operations within the Unity Hypernet.

### 

# Unity \- The company

Our ideals.  What makes us different and our guidelines we will run by.

## Ideals:

### Honor and Trust.

We vow to be the \#1 trusted brand in the world and to set the standard for integrity.  We will do this by making our business completely visible.  We will strive to always keep our word and stand in the spotlight for the world to examine our every move.  We will make every decision from the small to large with a focus on integrity.

### Global focus.

We vow not to get involved with, fund, or accept funds from any organization, religion or government for any special favors.  Our focus is every single human being on the earth, our government is the will of the human race, and our religion is love.  We will never take actions that will harm others and we seek for social justice free of dictatorship.

## Business Plan {#business-plan}

First I’ll get into the meat of what potential investors or contributors will want to know, and then I’ll get into the truly unique parts of Unity

## Target market {#target-market}

Unity Hypernet’s target audience is every person on the planet.  Knowledge is common to everyone, language is the only barrier.  Our platform is designed from the ground up to be multilingual

## Cost to individuals and businesses  Competition. {#cost-to-individuals-and-businesses-competition.}

This is a truly unique offering as we believe there will not be any competition.  This is not a matter of being blind to the possibilities of competition, but our unique business model and product that foster collaboration rather than competition

### Unique {#unique}

You know the quote from the Highlander movies?  “There can be only one\!”  The Hypernet is a platform to unify all human knowledge into one efficient massively distributed database.

### Fosters collaboration, not competition {#fosters-collaboration,-not-competition}

In an ultimate example of how people working together are more effective than individuals,  the Hypernet, or any potential competitors

# Thoughts, Social Impacts, and World Governments. {#thoughts,-social-impacts,-and-world-governments.}

Social Impacts.  The whole “Black Mirror” scenario

## Building a new world government {#building-a-new-world-government}

Should the project be successful and this work with the social structure running it, the same concepts and platform could be used to develop new types of democracy.  Some of the advantages:

Corruption Free.  With everything transparent and in the open, there is nowhere to hide corruption.

A new form of democracy where those who are educated and informed on subjects have a stronger voice than the educated.  Where they can make a vote with the best available information at their fingertips

With this type of government, the entire world would be able to join together as a single human government without fear of dictators taking control of the country.  This really could unify the human race.
